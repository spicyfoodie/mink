	abstract = {Directed migration by contact guidance is a poorly understood yet vital phenomenon, particularly for carcinoma cell invasion on aligned collagen fibres. We demonstrate that for single cells, aligned architectures providing contact guidance cues induce constrained focal adhesion maturation and associated F-actin alignment, consequently orchestrating anisotropic traction stresses that drive cell orientation and directional migration. Consistent with this understanding, relaxing spatial constraints to adhesion maturation either through reduction in substrate alignment density or reduction in adhesion size diminishes the contact guidance response. While such interactions allow single mesenchymal-like cells to spontaneously ‘sense' and follow topographic alignment, intercellular interactions within epithelial clusters temper anisotropic cell–substratum forces, resulting in substantially lower directional response. Overall, these results point to the control of contact guidance by a balance of cell–substratum and cell–cell interactions, modulated by cell phenotype-specific cytoskeletal arrangements. Thus, our findings elucidate how phenotypically diverse cells perceive ECM alignment at the molecular level., Contact guidance on aligned substrates leads to directed cell migration through a poorly defined mechanism. Here the authors show that alignment of adhesion structures and F-actin generates anisotropic traction stress to drive directional migration, and cell-cell contact reduces force orientation and directional response.},

	abstract = {Irreversible electroporation (IRE) can be used to treat cancer by electrical pulses, with advantages over traditional thermal approaches. Here we assess for the first time the IRE response of pancreatic cancer, one of the deadliest forms of cancer, both in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrate that both established and primary cancer cell lines can be destroyed by IRE, but with differential susceptibility and thresholds. We further demonstrate in vitro that viability for a given IRE dose can vary with the local chemistry as outcomes were shown to depend on suspending medium and reduction of glucose in the media significantly improved IRE destruction. Data here also demonstrate that repeated IRE treatments can lead to adaptive resistance in pancreatic carcinoma cells thereby reducing subsequent treatment efficacy. In addition, we demonstrate that physical enhancement of IRE, by re-arranging the pulse sequences without increasing the electrical energy delivered, achieve reduced viability in vitro and decreased tumor growth in an in vivo xenograft model. Together, these results show that IRE can destroy pancreatic cancer in vitro and in vivo, that there are both chemical and physical enhancements that can improve tumor destruction, and that one should guard against adaptive resistance when performing repeated treatments.},

	abstract = {Directed cell migration by contact guidance in aligned collagenous extracellular matrix (ECM) is a critical enabler of breast cancer dissemination. The mechanisms of this process are poorly understood, particularly in 3D, in part because of the lack of efficient methods to generate aligned collagen matrices. To address this technological gap, we propose a simple method to align collagen gels using guided cellular compaction. Our method yields highly aligned, acellular collagen constructs with predictable microstructural features, thus providing a controlled microenvironment for in vitro experiments. Quantifying cell behavior in these anisotropic constructs, we find that breast carcinoma cells are acutely sensitive to the direction and extent of collagen alignment. Further, live cell imaging and analysis of 3D cell migration reveals that alignment of collagen does not alter the total motility of breast cancer cells, but simply redirects their migration to produce largely one-dimensional movement. However, a profoundly enhanced motility in aligned collagen matrices is observed for the subpopulation of carcinoma cells with high tumor initiating and metastatic capacity, termed cancer stem cells (CSCs). Analysis of the biophysical determinants of cell migration show that nuclear deformation is not a critical factor associated with the observed increases in motility for CSCs. Rather, smaller cell size, a high degree of phenotypic plasticity, and increased protrusive activity emerge as vital facilitators of rapid, contact-guided migration of CSCs in aligned 3D collagen matrices.},

We demonstrate that collective cell migration is profoundly enhanced by the addition of contract guidance cues when not otherwise constrained. However, while nanoscale cues promoted migration in all cases, microscale directed migration cues are dominant as the geometric constraint narrows, a behavior that is well explained by stochastic diffusion anisotropy modeling. Further, oncogene activation (i.e. mutant PIK3CA) resulted in profoundly increased migration where extracellular multiscale directed migration cues and intrinsic signaling synergistically conspire to greatly outperform normal cells or any extracellular guidance cues in isolation.},

	abstract = {Elevated interstitial fluid pressure can present a substantial barrier to drug delivery in solid tumors. This is particularly true of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, a highly lethal disease characterized by a robust fibroinflammatory response, widespread vascular collapse, and hypoperfusion that together serve as primary mechanisms of treatment resistance. Free-fluid pressures, however, are relatively low in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and cannot account for the vascular collapse. Indeed, we have shown that the overexpression and deposition in the interstitium of high-molecular-weight hyaluronan (HA) is principally responsible for generating pressures that can reach 100 mmHg through the creation of a large gel-fluid phase. By interrogating a variety of tissues, tumor types, and experimental model systems, we show that an HA-dependent fluid phase contributes substantially to pressures in many solid tumors and has been largely unappreciated heretofore. We investigated the relative contributions of both freely mobile fluid and gel fluid to interstitial fluid pressure by performing simultaneous, real-time fluid-pressure measurements with both the classical wick-in-needle method (to estimate free-fluid pressure) and a piezoelectric pressure catheter transducer (which is capable of capturing pressures associated with either phase). We demonstrate further that systemic treatment with pegylated recombinant hyaluronidase (PEGPH20) depletes interstitial HA and eliminates the gel-fluid phase. This significantly reduces interstitial pressures and leaves primarily free fluid behind, relieving the barrier to drug delivery. These findings argue that quantifying the contributions of free- and gel-fluid phases to hydraulically transmitted pressures in a given cancer will be essential to designing the most appropriate and effective strategies to overcome this important and frequently underestimated resistance mechanism.},

	abstract = {Extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins are structural elements of tissue and also potent signaling molecules. Previously, our laboratory showed that ECM of 2D coatings can trigger differentiation of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into mesodermal lineages in an ECM-specific manner over 14 days, in some cases comparable to chemical induction. To test whether a similar effect was possible in a 3D, tissue-like environment, we designed a synthetic-natural biomaterial composite. The composite can present whole-molecule ECM proteins to cells, even those that do not spontaneously form hydrogels ex vivo, in 3D. To this end, we entrapped collagen type I, laminin-111, or fibronectin in ECM composites with MSCs and directly compared markers of mesodermal differentiation including cardiomyogenic (ACTC1), osteogenic (SPP1), adipogenic (PPARG), and chondrogenic (SOX9) in 2D versus 3D. We found the 3D condition largely mimicked the 2D condition such that the addition of type I collagen was the most potent inducer of differentiation to all lineages tested. One notable difference between 2D and 3D was pronounced adipogenic differentiation in 3D especially in the presence of exogenous collagen type I. In particular, PPARG gene expression was significantly increased ∼16-fold relative to chemical induction, in 3D and not in 2D. Unexpectedly, 3D engagement of ECM proteins also altered immunomodulatory function of MSCs in that expression of IL-6 gene was elevated relative to basal levels in 2D. In fact, levels of IL-6 gene expression in 3D composites containing exogenously supplied collagen type I or fibronectin were statistically similar to levels attained in 2D with tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) stimulation and these levels were sustained over a 2-week period. Thus, this novel biomaterial platform allowed us to compare the biochemical impact of whole-molecule ECM proteins in 2D versus 3D indicating enhanced adipogenic differentiation and IL-6 expression of MSC in the 3D context. Exploiting the biochemical impact of ECM proteins on MSC differentiation and immunomodulation could augment the therapeutic utility of MSCs.},

	abstract = {The notion that cell shape and spreading can regulate cell proliferation has evolved over several years, but only recently has this been linked to forces from within and upon the cell. This emerging area of mechanical signaling is proving to be wide-spread and important for all cell types. The microenvironment that surrounds cells provides a complex spectrum of different, simultaneously active, biochemical, structural and mechanical stimuli. In this milieu, cells probe the stiffness of their microenvironment by pulling on the extracellular matrix (ECM) and/or adjacent cells. This process is dependent on transcellular cell-ECM or cell-cell adhesions, as well as cell contractility mediated by Rho GTPases, to provide a functional linkage through which forces are transmitted through the cytoskeleton by intracellular force-generating proteins. This Commentary covers recent advances in the underlying mechanisms that control cell proliferation by mechanical signaling, with an emphasis on the role of 3D microenvironments and in vivo extracellular matrices. Moreover, as there is much recent interest in the tumor-stromal interaction, we will pay particular attention to exciting new data describing the role of mechanical signaling in the progression of breast cancer.},

	abstract = {Evidence for the potent influence of stromal organization and function on invasion and metastasis of breast tumors is ever growing. We have performed a rigorous examination of the relationship of a tumor-associated collagen signature-3 (TACS-3) to the long-term survival rate of human patients. TACS-3 is characterized by bundles of straightened and aligned collagen fibers that are oriented perpendicular to the tumor boundary. An evaluation of TACS-3 was performed in biopsied tissue sections from 196 patients by second harmonic generation imaging of the backscattered signal generated by collagen. Univariate analysis of a Cox proportional hazard model demonstrated that the presence of TACS-3 was associated with poor disease-specific and disease-free survival, resulting in hazard ratios between 3.0 and 3.9. Furthermore, TACS-3 was confirmed to be an independent prognostic indicator regardless of tumor grade and size, estrogen or progesterone receptor status, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 status, node status, and tumor subtype. Interestingly, TACS-3 was positively correlated to expression of stromal syndecan-1, a receptor for several extracellular matrix proteins including collagens. Because of the strong statistical evidence for poor survival in patients with TACS, and because the assessment can be performed in routine histopathological samples imaged via second harmonic generation or using picrosirius, we propose that quantifying collagen alignment is a viable, novel paradigm for the prediction of human breast cancer survival.},

Recently, using tissue-specific FAK-knockout in mouse models of human cancer, the consequences of FAK ablation in carcinoma were demonstrated by multiple independent research groups. Strong consensus evidence indicates that epithelial cells are able to transform in the absence of FAK, but do not undergo a malignant conversion to invasive carcinoma, and as such, metastasis is impaired. This is likely the consequence of decreased Src and p130Cas activation in concert with misregulated actin cytoskeleton dynamics and Rho GTPase signaling.

	abstract = {The classical examination of histology slides from a mouse model of breast cancer has been extended in this study to incorporate modern multiphoton excitation and photon-counting techniques. The advantage of such approaches is quantification of potential diagnostic parameters from the fluorescence emission signal, whereby the traditional descriptive staging process is complemented by measurements of fluorescence intensity, lifetime, and spectra. We explored whether the clinical "gold standard" of eosin and hematoxylin stained histology slides would provide optical biomarker signatures of diagnostic value. Alternatively, we examined unstained slides for changes in intensity and/or fluorescence lifetime of relevant endogenous fluorophores. Although eosin provided a strong emission signal and had distinct spectra and lifetime, we found that it was not useful as a fluorescent biological marker, particularly when combined with hematoxylin. Instead, we found that the properties of the fluorescence from the endogenous fluorophores NADH and FAD were indicative of the pathological state of the tissue. Comparing regions of carcinoma in situ to adjacent histologically normal regions, we found that tumor cells produced higher intensity and had a longer fluorescence lifetime. By imaging at 780 nm and 890 nm excitation, we were able to differentiate the fluorescence of FAD from NADH by separating the emission spectra. The shift to a longer lifetime in tumor cells was independent of the free or bound state of FAD and NADH, and of the excitation wavelength. Most forms of cancer have altered metabolism and redox ratios; here we present a method that has potential for early detection of these changes, which are preserved in fixed tissue samples such as classic histopathology slides.},

Compared to other optical methods these modalities provide superior depth penetration and viability and have the additional advantage in that they are compatible technologies that can be applied simultaneously. Therefore, application of these nonlinear optical approaches to the study of breast cancer holds particular promise as these techniques can be used to image exogeneous fluorophores such as green fluorescent protein as well as intrinsic signals such as SHG from collagen and endogenous fluorescence from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide or flavin adenine dinucleotide. In this article the application of multiphoton excitation, SHG, and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy to relevant issues regarding the tumor-stromal interaction, cellular metabolism, and cell signaling in breast cancer is described. Furthermore, the ability to record and monitor the intrinsic fluorescence and SHG signals provides a unique tool for researchers to understand key events in cancer progression in its natural context.},

Despite evidence demonstrating FAK overexpression in human cancer, its role in tumor initiation and progression is not well understood. Using Cre/LoxP technology to specifically knockout FAK in the mammary epithelium, we showed that FAK is not required for tumor initiation but is required for tumor progression. The mechanistic underpinnings of these results suggested that FAK regulates clinically relevant gene signatures and multiple signaling complexes associated with tumor progression and metastasis, such as Src, ERK, and p130Cas. Furthermore, a systems-level analysis identified FAK as a major regulator of the tumor transcriptome, influencing genes associated with adhesion and growth factor signaling pathways, and their cross talk. Additionally, FAK was shown to down-regulate the expression of clinically relevant proliferation- and metastasis-associated gene signatures, as well as an enriched group of genes associated with the G(2) and G(2)/M phases of the cell cycle. Computational analysis of transcription factor-binding sites within ontology-enriched or clustered gene sets suggested that the differentially expressed proliferation- and metastasis-associated genes in FAK-null cells were regulated through a common set of transcription factors, including p53. Therefore, FAK acts as a primary node in the activated signaling network in transformed motile cells and is a prime candidate for novel therapeutic interventions to treat aggressive human breast cancers.},

Likewise, tumor cells invading into three-dimensional (3D) matrices remodel the ECM microenvironment. Importantly, we previously reported a distinct radial reorganization of the collagen matrix surrounding tumors that facilitates local invasion. Here we describe a mechanism by which cells utilize contractility events to reorganize the ECM to provide contact guidance that facilitates 3D migration. Using novel assays to differentially organize the collagen matrix we show that alignment of collagen perpendicular to the tumor-explant boundary promotes local invasion of both human and mouse mammary epithelial cells. In contrast, organizing the collagen matrix to mimic the ECM organization associated with noninvading regions of tumors suppresses 3D migration/invasion. Moreover, we demonstrate that matrix reorganization is contractility-dependent and that the Rho/Rho kinase pathway is necessary for collagen alignment to provide contact guidance. Yet, if matrices are prealigned, inhibiting neither Rho nor Rho kinase inhibits 3D migration, which supports our conclusion that Rho-mediated matrix alignment is an early step in the invasion process, preceding and subsequently facilitating 3D migration.},

To observe invasion and metastasis with sub-cellular resolution in vivo, multiphoton microscopy (MPM) allows imaging more deeply into tissues with less toxicity, compared with other optical imaging methods. MPM can be combined with second harmonic generation (SHG), fluorescent lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM), and spectral-lifetime imaging microscopy (SLIM). SHG facilitates imaging of stromal collagen and tumor-stroma interactions, including the architecture and remodeling of the tumor microenvironment. FLIM allows characterization of exogenous and endogenous fluorophores, such as the metabolites FAD and NADH to score for metabolic state and provide optical biomarkers. SLIM permits additional identification and separation of endogenous and exogenous fluorophores by simultaneously collecting their spectra and lifetime, producing an optical molecular "fingerprint". Both FLIM and SLIM also serve as an improved method for the assessment of Förster (or fluorescence) resonance energy transfer (FRET). Hence, the use and further development of these approaches strongly enhances the visualization and quantification of tumor progression, invasion, and metastasis.

	doi = {10.1186/1741-7015-6-11},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mammographically dense breast tissue is one of the greatest risk factors for developing breast carcinoma. Despite the strong clinical correlation, breast density has not been causally linked to tumorigenesis, largely because no animal model has existed for studying breast tissue density. Importantly, regions of high breast density are associated with increased stromal collagen. Thus, the influence of the extracellular matrix on breast carcinoma development and the underlying molecular mechanisms are not understood.
METHODS: To study the effects of collagen density on mammary tumor formation and progression, we utilized a bi-transgenic tumor model with increased stromal collagen in mouse mammary tissue. Imaging of the tumors and tumor-stromal interface in live tumor tissue was performed with multiphoton laser-scanning microscopy to generate multiphoton excitation and spectrally resolved fluorescent lifetimes of endogenous fluorophores. Second harmonic generation was utilized to image stromal collagen.
RESULTS: Herein we demonstrate that increased stromal collagen in mouse mammary tissue significantly increases tumor formation approximately three-fold (p {\textless} 0.00001) and results in a significantly more invasive phenotype with approximately three times more lung metastasis (p {\textless} 0.05). Furthermore, the increased invasive phenotype of tumor cells that arose within collagen-dense mammary tissues remains after tumor explants are cultured within reconstituted three-dimensional collagen gels. To better understand this behavior we imaged live tumors using nonlinear optical imaging approaches to demonstrate that local invasion is facilitated by stromal collagen re-organization and that this behavior is significantly increased in collagen-dense tissues. In addition, using multiphoton fluorescence and spectral lifetime imaging we identify a metabolic signature for flavin adenine dinucleotide, with increased fluorescent intensity and lifetime, in invading metastatic cells.
CONCLUSION: This study provides the first data causally linking increased stromal collagen to mammary tumor formation and metastasis, and demonstrates that fundamental differences arise and persist in epithelial tumor cells that progressed within collagen-dense microenvironments. Furthermore, the imaging techniques and signature identified in this work may provide useful diagnostic tools to rapidly assess fresh tissue biopsies.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) plays a crucial role in wound healing and tissue repair. We tested the hypotheses that systemic administration of IGF-I, or growth hormone (GH), or both (GH+IGF-I) would improve healing in collagenous connective tissue, such as ligament. These hypotheses were examined in rats that were allowed unrestricted activity after injury and in animals that were subjected to hindlimb disuse. Male rats were assigned to three groups: ambulatory sham-control, ambulatory-healing, and hindlimb unloaded-healing. Ambulatory and hindlimb unloaded animals underwent surgical disruption of their knee medial collateral ligaments (MCLs), while sham surgeries were performed on control animals. Healing animals subcutaneously received systemic doses of either saline, GH, IGF-I, or GH+IGF-I. After 3 weeks, mechanical properties, cell and matrix morphology, and biochemical composition were examined in control and healing ligaments.
RESULTS: Tissues from ambulatory animals receiving only saline had significantly greater strength than tissue from saline receiving hindlimb unloaded animals. Addition of IGF-I significantly improved maximum force and ultimate stress in tissues from both ambulatory and hindlimb unloaded animals with significant increases in matrix organization and type-I collagen expression. Addition of GH alone did not have a significant effect on either group, while addition of GH+IGF-I significantly improved force, stress, and modulus values in MCLs from hindlimb unloaded animals. Force, stress, and modulus values in tissues from hindlimb unloaded animals receiving IGF-I or GH+IGF-I exceeded (or were equivalent to) values in tissues from ambulatory animals receiving only saline with greatly improved structural organization and significantly increased type-I collagen expression. Furthermore, levels of IGF-receptor were significantly increased in tissues from hindlimb unloaded animals treated with IGF-I.
CONCLUSION: These results support two of our hypotheses that systemic administration of IGF-I or GH+IGF-I improve healing in collagenous tissue. Systemic administration of IGF-I improves healing in collagenous extracellular matrices from loaded and unloaded tissues. Growth hormone alone did not result in any significant improvement contrary to our hypothesis, while GH + IGF-I produced remarkable improvement in hindlimb unloaded animals.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Stromal-epithelial interactions are of particular significance in breast tissue as misregulation of these interactions can promote tumorigenesis and invasion. Moreover, collagen-dense breast tissue increases the risk of breast carcinoma, although the relationship between collagen density and tumorigenesis is not well understood. As little is known about epithelial-stromal interactions in vivo, it is necessary to visualize the stroma surrounding normal epithelium and mammary tumors in intact tissues to better understand how matrix organization, density, and composition affect tumor formation and progression.
METHODS: Epithelial-stromal interactions in normal mammary glands, mammary tumors, and tumor explants in three-dimensional culture were studied with histology, electron microscopy, and nonlinear optical imaging methodologies. Imaging of the tumor-stromal interface in live tumor tissue ex vivo was performed with multiphoton laser-scanning microscopy (MPLSM) to generate multiphoton excitation (MPE) of endogenous fluorophores and second harmonic generation (SHG) to image stromal collagen.
RESULTS: We used both laser-scanning multiphoton and second harmonic generation microscopy to determine the organization of specific collagen structures around ducts and tumors in intact, unfixed and unsectioned mammary glands. Local alterations in collagen density were clearly seen, allowing us to obtain three-dimensional information regarding the organization of the mammary stroma, such as radiating collagen fibers that could not have been obtained using classical histological techniques. Moreover, we observed and defined three tumor-associated collagen signatures (TACS) that provide novel markers to locate and characterize tumors. In particular, local cell invasion was found predominantly to be oriented along certain aligned collagen fibers, suggesting that radial alignment of collagen fibers relative to tumors facilitates invasion. Consistent with this observation, primary tumor explants cultured in a randomly organized collagen matrix realigned the collagen fibers, allowing individual tumor cells to migrate out along radially aligned fibers.
CONCLUSION: The presentation of these tumor-associated collagen signatures allowed us to identify pre-palpable tumors and see cells at the tumor-stromal boundary invading into the stroma along radially aligned collagen fibers. As such, TACS should provide indications that a tumor is, or could become, invasive, and may serve as part of a strategy to help identify and characterize breast tumors in animal and human tissues.},

	abstract = {Connective tissue mechanical behavior is primarily determined by the composition and organization of collagen. In ligaments and tendons, type I collagen is the principal structural element of the extracellular matrix, which acts to transmit force between bones or bone and muscle, respectively. Therefore, characterization of collagen fibril morphology and organization in fetal and skeletally mature animals is essential to understanding how tissues develop and obtain their mechanical attributes. In this study, tendons and ligaments from fetal rat, bovine, and feline, and mature rat were examined with scanning electron microscopy. At early fetal developmental stages, collagen fibrils show fibril overlap and interweaving, apparent fibril ends, and numerous bifurcating/fusing fibrils. Late in fetal development, collagen fibril ends are still present and fibril bundles (fibers) are clearly visible. Examination of collagen fibrils from skeletally mature tissues, reveals highly organized regions but still include fibril interweaving, and regions that are more randomly organized. Fibril bifurcations/fusions are still present in mature tissues but are less numerous than in fetal tissue. To address the continuity of fibrils in mature tissues, fibrils were examined in individual micrographs and consecutive overlaid micrographs. Extensive microscopic analysis of mature tendons and ligaments detected no fibril ends. These data strongly suggest that fibrils in mature ligament and tendon are either continuous or functionally continuous. Based upon this information and published data, we conclude that force within these tissues is directly transferred through collagen fibrils and not through an interfibrillar coupling, such as a proteoglycan bridge.},

	abstract = {Numerous studies have examined wound healing and tissue repair after a complete tissue rupture and reported provisional matrix and scar tissue formation in the injury gap. The initial phases of the repair are largely mediated by the coagulation response and a principally extrinsic inflammatory response followed by type III collagen deposition to form scar tissue that may be later remodeled. In this study, we examine subfailure (Grade II sprain) damage to collagenous matrices in which no gross tissue gap is present and a localized concentration of provisional matrix or scar tissue does not form. This results in extracellular matrix remodeling that relies heavily upon type I collagen, and associated proteoglycans, and less heavily on type III scar tissue collagen. For instance, following subfailure tissue damage, collagen I and III expression was suppressed after 1 day, but by day 7 expression of both genes was significantly increased over controls, with collagen I expression significantly larger than type III expression. Concurrent with increased collagen expression were significantly increased expression of the collagen fibrillogenesis supporting proteoglycans fibromodulin, lumican, decorin, the large aggregating proteoglycan versican, and proteases cathepsin K and L. Interestingly, this remodeling process appears intrinsic with little or no inflammation response as damaged tissues show no changes in macrophage or neutrophils levels following injury and expression of the inflammatory markers, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase were unchanged. Hence, since inflammation plays a large role in wound healing by inducing cell migration and proliferation, and controlling extracellular matrix scar formation, its absence leaves fibroblasts to principally direct tissue remodeling. Therefore, following a Grade II subfailure injury to the collagen matrix, we conclude that tissue remodeling is fibroblast-mediated and occurs without scar tissue formation, but instead with type I collagen fibrillogenesis to repair the tissue. As such, this system provides unique insight into acute tissue damage and offers a potentially powerful model to examine fibroblast behavior.},

We hypothesized that in the rabbit MCL the rate of stress relaxation would be strain dependent and the rate of creep would be stress dependent. Thirty MCLs from 15 rabbits were tested ex vivo for this study. Results show that within the physiologically relevant region of ligament behavior, the rate of stress relaxation is strain dependent in the rabbit MCL, with the rate of relaxation decreasing with increasing tissue strain. The rate of creep is stress dependent in the rabbit MCL, with the rate of creep decreasing with increasing stress. These results support our hypothesis, with the greatest nonlinearities in a physiologically relevant region of loading. As such, these nonlinearities should be considered when quantifying ligament viscoelastic behavior with a rabbit model.},

Fifteen animals were treated for 10 days with the sympathetic chemotoxin guanethidine using osmotic pumps, whereas 15 control rats received pumps containing saline. A reduction in plasma concentrations of norepinephrine in the guanethidine rats indicated a significant decrease in sympathetic nerve activity. Vasoactive intestinal peptide and neuropeptide Y were decreased in MCLs from guanethidine animals, as quantified by radioimmunoassays. Tissue vascularity was substantially increased in guanethidine MCLs, whereas mechanical properties were significantly decreased. Proteases, such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) and cysteine proteases, play a major role in ligament degradation. The proteases MMP-13, cathepsin K, and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) have collagenolytic activity and have been shown in rat ligament tissues. To determine whether the degradation seen in this study was due to protease activity, we determined the expression of these enzymes in control and treated MCLs. Real-time quantitative PCR revealed that guanethidine treatment increased expression of MMP-13 and cathepsin K mRNAs, although overall expression levels of MMP-13 and TRAP were relatively low. Histology also identified increases in TRAP and cathepsin K, but not MMP-13, in guanethidine-treated tissues. Results support our hypothesis that blockade of the sympathetic nervous system substantially degrades ligament.},

	abstract = {This study shows how a probabilistic microstructural model for fibrous connective tissue behavior can be used to objectively describe soft tissue low-load behavior. More specifically, methods to determine tissue reference length and the transition from the strain-stiffening "toe-region" to the more linear region of the stress-strain curve of fibrous connective tissues are presented. According to a microstructural model for uniaxially loaded collagenous tissues, increasingly more fibers are recruited and bear load with increased tissue elongation. Fiber recruitment is represented statistically according to a Weibull probability density function (PDF). The Weibull PDF location parameter in this formulation corresponds to the stretch at which the first fibers begin to bear load and provides a convenient method of determining reference length. The toe-to-linear region transition is defined by utilizing the Weibull cumulative distribution function (CDF) which relates the fraction of loaded fibers to the tissue elongation. These techniques are illustrated using representative tendon and ligament data from the literature, and are shown to be applicable retrospectively to data from specimens that are not heavily preloaded. The reference length resulting from this technique provides an objective datum from which to calculate stretch, strain, and tangent modulus, while the Weibull CDF provides an objective parameter with which to characterize the limits of low-load behavior.},

Rat ligaments were subjected either to creep or stress relaxation for 1,000 s or stress relaxation for 10,000 s to compare estimates of viscoelastic behavior for different test durations. Stresses versus time (relaxation) or strains versus time (creep) were fit with power law models (tbeta where beta is the rate of creep or relaxation on a log-log scale). Time intervals were separated by logarithmic decade and analyzed using a Random Coefficients approach to compute residual specimen error as a function of the number of decades of data analyzed. Standard Regression was also used for comparison. Results show that by testing for {\textless}/=100 s (i.e. two logarithmic decades of time) offers 1\% less accuracy than testing for 1,000 seconds (i.e. three decades) when estimating the viscoelastic behavior of a specimen. These 100 s power law estimates are far more accurate than the between specimen dispersion of viscoelastic properties. Hence, a better way to compare viscoelastic behavior between study groups is to test more specimens for shorter durations. This reduces experimental time per sample and therefore increases efficiency.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study was to observe and compare behavior of the collagen fiber microstructure in normal and healing ligaments, both in situ and ex vivo, in order to add insight into the structure-function relationship in normal and healing ligaments. Fifty-two ligaments from 26 male rats were investigated. Eleven animals underwent surgical transection of both medial collateral ligaments (MCLs) (22 ligaments), which were allowed to heal for a period of 2 weeks. An additional 15 animals (30 ligaments) were used as normals. Ligaments were placed into six groups: Slack (n = 6 control, n = 6 healing), Reference (n = 4 control, n = 4 healing), Loaded (n = 4 control, n = 4 healing), 15 degrees Flexion (n = 4 control, n = 4 healing), 120 degrees Flexion (n = 4 control, n = 4 healing), and Tissue Strain vs. Flexion Angle (n = 8 normals). All ligaments, except those in the Tissue Strain vs. Flexion Angle group, were prepared for scanning electron microscopy. Tissues were harvested, mounted in a load frame, and chemically fixed in one of five states: (1). slack, (2). reference (onset of loading), (3). loaded, (4). 15 degrees knee flexion, or (5). 120 degrees knee flexion. After fixation the tissues were prepared for electron microscopy (SEM). The micrographs from the slack, reference, and loaded groups show fiber straightening with loading in normal ligaments as well as in both scar and "retracted" regions of healing ligaments. Collagen fibers' diameter and crimp patterns were dramatically changed in the scar region of healing ligaments: Width decreased from 19.4 +/- 1.7 microm to 6.5 +/- 2.1 microm (p {\textless}.000001), period from 51.4 +/- 15.1 microm to 11.0 +/- 2.4 microm (p {\textless}.000001), and amplitude from 9.8 +/- 0.8 microm to 3.9 +/- 0.8 microm (p {\textless}.000001). Normal ligaments fixed in situ show wavy regions at 120 degrees but less so at 15 degrees flexion. Healing ligaments fixed in situ show regions of fiber waviness in the scar region at 120 degrees and also at 15 degrees flexion, indicating ligament laxity persists toward both extremes of the range of motion. The data suggest that straightening of crimped fibers is a functionally relevant phenomenon, not only in normal but also in healing ligaments.},

Wall shear stress estimates are obtained by solving the momentum integral equation using the method proposed by Walz and applying this method to various stenosis geometries for Reynolds numbers (Re) of Re = 59-1000. Elevated wall shear stress may be of importance when considering thrombosis and vascular erosion in stenosis, as well as the potential for debris from the stenotic area to 'break away' and cause further pathology. The values of shear stress obtained using the model in this study agree well with published values of wall shear stress. When compared to a previously published boundary layer model utilizing the Thwaites method (Reese and Thompson, 1998), the model proposed herein performs better at higher Re while the model utilizing the Thwaites method performs better at lower Re. Wall shear stresses are shown to increase with increasing stenosis (increased area reduction) for a given stenosis length, increase with increasing Re for a given stenosis geometry, and increase for steeper stenosis of the same constriction. The boundary layer model proposed can be easily implemented by clinical researchers to provide in vivo estimates of wall shear stress through arterial stenoses.},

Male rats were assigned to 3- and 7-wk treatment groups with three subgroups each: sham control, ambulatory healing, and hindlimb-suspended healing. Ambulatory and suspended animals underwent surgical rupture of their medial collateral ligaments, whereas sham surgeries were performed on control animals. After 3 or 7 wk, mechanical and/or morphological properties were measured in ligament, muscle, and bone. During mechanical testing, most suspended ligaments failed in the scar region, indicating the greatest impairment was to ligament and not to bone-ligament insertion. Ligament testing revealed significant reductions in maximum force, ultimate stress, elastic modulus, and low-load properties in suspended animals. In addition, femoral mineral density, femoral strength, gastrocnemius mass, and tibialis anterior mass were significantly reduced. Microscopy revealed abnormal scar formation and cell distribution in suspended ligaments with extracellular matrix discontinuities and voids between misaligned, but well-formed, collagen fiber bundles. Hence, stress levels from ambulation appear unnecessary for formation of fiber bundles yet required for collagen to form structurally competent continuous fibers. Results support our hypothesis that hindlimb unloading impairs healing of fibrous connective tissue. In addition, this study provides compelling morphological evidence explaining the altered structure-function relationship in load-deprived healing connective tissue.},

One randomly selected LCL was stretched in situ using a custom designed device in eighteen young (21 days) and eighteen skeletally mature (8 months) male rats. Animals were euthanized at 0, 7, and 14 days post-surgery, and ligament ultimate stress, strain at failure and laxity were determined (n = 6 pairs per group). At time 0 after introduction of stretch injury, ligament laxity was present in both groups. The mature rats had 54 +/- 9\% strength of the control while the immature rats had 58 +/- 11\% of the strength of the control, representing a consistent and significant injury. The immature and mature ligaments showed similar patterns of cellular damage post-injury and had similar modes of mechanical failure. Ligament laxity decreased in each group as healing time increased, however ligament laxity did not completely recover in either group after 2 weeks of healing. After 7 and 14 days of healing, the mature rats, respectively, had only 63 +/- 14\%\% and 80 +/- 8\% strengths of the controls while the immature rats had 94 +/- 6\% and 94 +/- 10\%. Hence, mechanical data showed that immature animals recovered their strength after a grade II sprain at a faster rate than mature animals. However, ligament laxity was still present in both groups two weeks after the injury and was not completely removed by growth in the immature group. These findings are clinically relevant since joint laxity after injury is common, and these results may explain the presence of continued instability in a joint injured at a young age. Hence, this study, with a new injury model, showed differences in ligament healing associated with maturity and quantified the clinically observed persistance of ligament laxity.},

	abstract = {Subfailure damage in ligaments was evaluated macroscopically from a structural perspective (referring to the entire ligament as a structure) and microscopically from a cellular perspective. Freshly harvested rat medial collateral ligaments (MCLs) were used as a model in ex vivo experiments. Ligaments were preloaded with 0.1 N to establish a consistent point of reference for length (and strain) measurements. Ligament structural damage was characterized by nonrecoverable difference in tissue length after a subfailure stretch. The tissue's mechanical properties (via stress vs. strain curves measured from a preloaded state) after a single subfailure stretch were also evaluated (n = 6 pairs with a different stretch magnitude applied to each stretched ligament). Regions containing necrotic cells were used to characterize cellular damage after a single stretch. It should be noted that the number of damaged cells was not quantified and the difference between cellular area and area of fluorescence is not known. Structural and cellular damage were represented and compared as functions of subfailure MCL strains. Statistical analysis indicated that the onset of structural damage occurs at 5.14\% strain (referenced from a preloaded length). Subfailure strains above the damage threshold changed the shape of the MCL stress-strain curve by elongating the toe region (i.e., increasing laxity) as well as decreasing the tangential modulus and ultimate stress. Cellular damage was induced at ligament strains significantly below the structural damage threshold. This cellular damage is likely to be part of the natural healing process in mildly sprained ligaments.},

	abstract = {Zebrafish, an established model organism in developmental biology, is also a valuable tool for imaging wound healing in space and time with cellular resolution. However, long-term imaging of wound healing poses technical challenges as wound healing occurs over multiple temporal scales. The traditional strategy of larval encapsulation in agarose successfully limits sample movement but impedes larval development and tissue regrowth and is therefore not amenable to long-term imaging of wound healing. To overcome this challenge, we engineered a functionally compartmentalized device, the zebrafish Wounding and Entrapment Device for Growth and Imaging (zWEDGI), to orient larvae for high-resolution microscopy, including confocal and second harmonic generation (SHG), while allowing unrestrained tail development and regrowth. In this device, larval viability was maintained and tail regrowth was improved over embedding in agarose. The quality of tail fiber SHG images collected from larvae in the device was similar to fixed samples but provided the benefit of time lapse data collection. Furthermore, we show that this device was amenable to long-term ({\textgreater}24 h) confocal microscopy of the caudal fin. Finally, the zWEDGI was designed and fabricated using readily available techniques so that it can be easily modified for diverse experimental imaging protocols.},

	doi = {10.1002/dvdy.24359},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Distal-less (Dll) encodes a homeodomain transcription factor expressed in developing appendages of organisms throughout metazoan phylogeny. Based on earlier observations in the limbless nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and the primitive chordate amphioxus, it was proposed that Dll had an ancestral function in nervous system development. Consistent with this hypothesis, Dll is necessary for the development of both peripheral and central components of the Drosophila olfactory system. Furthermore, vertebrate homologs of Dll, the Dlx genes, play critical roles in mammalian brain development.
RESULTS: Using fluorescent immunohistochemistry of fixed samples and multiphoton microscopy of living Drosophila embryos, we show that Dll is expressed in the embryonic, larval and adult central nervous system and peripheral nervous system (PNS) in embryonic and larval neurons, brain and ventral nerve cord glia, as well as in PNS structures associated with chemosensation. In adult flies, Dll expression is expressed in the optic lobes, central brain regions and the antennal lobes.
CONCLUSIONS: Characterization of Dll expression in the developing nervous system supports a role of Dll in neural development and function and establishes an important basis for determining the specific functional roles of Dll in Drosophila development and for comparative studies of Drosophila Dll functions with those of its vertebrate counterparts.},

We examined the efficacy of utilizing the endogenous optical signals of two important ECM proteins, elastin (Eln), through autofluorescence, and type I collagen (ColI), through second harmonic generation (SHG), during mouse embryonic stem cell differentiation. After finding favorable overlap between antibody labeling and the endogenous fluorescent signal of Eln, we used this endogenous signal to map temporal changes in Eln and ColI during murine embryoid body differentiation and found that Eln increases until day 9 and then decreases slightly by day 12, while Col1 steadily increases over the 12-day period. Furthermore, we combined endogenous fluorescence imaging and SHG with antibody labeling of cardiomyocytes to examine the spatial relationship between Eln and ColI accumulation and cardiomyocyte differentiation. Eln was ubiquitously present, with enrichment in regions with cardiomyocyte differentiation, while there was an inverse correlation between ColI and cardiomyocyte differentiation. This work provides an important first step for utilizing endogenous optical signals, which can be visualized in living cells, to understand the relationship between the ECM and cardiomyocyte development and sets the stage for future studies of stem cell-ECM interactions and dynamics relevant to stem cells as well as other cell and tissue types.},

To study student learning, a curriculum was developed incorporating resources from the Caenorhabditis elegans research community. Students engaged in a preactivity assessment, followed by instructional materials (IMs) emphasizing inquiry-based learning and a postinstruction assessment to gauge their learning. This study, conducted at two research sites with eight and nine students, respectively, shows that before instruction, most students confused embryonic cell cleavage, where total volume is constant, with regular cell division, in which total cell volume doubles. Despite their ability to construct a cell lineage tree, most of the study participants were not aware of its biological significance. All students correctly identified cells of anterior and posterior axis, but not cells of the dorsal and ventral axis. Although the students had no difficulty with the time dimensional aspect of development, most viewed an embryo as spatially two-dimensional rather than three-dimensional. Furthermore, this study indicates that combining authentic research resources with inquiry-based learning benefits student learning of key concepts in embryology.},

	abstract = {The interferon-inducible transmembrane (IFITM) protein family represents a new class of cellular restriction factors that block early stages of viral replication; the underlying mechanism is currently not known. Here we provide evidence that IFITM proteins restrict membrane fusion induced by representatives of all three classes of viral membrane fusion proteins. IFITM1 profoundly suppressed syncytia formation and cell-cell fusion induced by almost all viral fusion proteins examined; IFITM2 and IFITM3 also strongly inhibited their fusion, with efficiency somewhat dependent on cell types. Furthermore, treatment of cells with IFN also markedly inhibited viral membrane fusion and entry. By using the Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus envelope and influenza A virus hemagglutinin as models for study, we showed that IFITM-mediated restriction on membrane fusion is not at the steps of receptor- and/or low pH-mediated triggering; instead, the creation of hemifusion was essentially blocked by IFITMs. Chlorpromazine (CPZ), a chemical known to promote the transition from hemifusion to full fusion, was unable to rescue the IFITM-mediated restriction on fusion. In contrast, oleic acid (OA), a lipid analog that generates negative spontaneous curvature and thereby promotes hemifusion, virtually overcame the restriction. To explore the possible effect of IFITM proteins on membrane molecular order and fluidity, we performed fluorescence labeling with Laurdan, in conjunction with two-photon laser scanning and fluorescence-lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). We observed that the generalized polarizations (GPs) and fluorescence lifetimes of cell membranes expressing IFITM proteins were greatly enhanced, indicating higher molecularly ordered and less fluidized membranes. Collectively, our data demonstrated that IFITM proteins suppress viral membrane fusion before the creation of hemifusion, and suggested that they may do so by reducing membrane fluidity and conferring a positive spontaneous curvature in the outer leaflets of cell membranes. Our study provides novel insight into the understanding of how IFITM protein family restricts viral membrane fusion and infection., Many pathogenic viruses contain an envelope that must fuse with the cell membrane in order to gain entry and initiate infection. This process is mediated by one or more glycoproteins present on the surface of the virions, known as viral fusion proteins. Recently, a family of interferon-inducible transmembrane (IFITM) protein has been shown to block viral infection, including those of highly pathogenic viruses. Here we provide evidence that these IFITM proteins potently suppress membrane fusion induced by representatives of all three classes of viral fusion proteins. Interestingly, we found that the block is not at the steps of receptor binding or low pH that triggers conformational changes of viral fusion proteins required for membrane fusion. Rather, we discovered that the creation of hemifusion, an intermediate in which the outer membranes of the two lipid bilayers have merged but the inner membranes still remain intact is blocked by IFITM proteins. We further demonstrated that overexpression of IFITM proteins rigidify the cell membrane, thereby reducing membrane fluidity and fusion potential. Our study provides novel insight into the understanding of how IFITM proteins restrict viral entry and infection.},

	abstract = {Background
A plastic chromatin structure has emerged as fundamental to the self-renewal and pluripotent capacity of embryonic stem (ES) cells. Direct measurement of chromatin dynamics in vivo is, however, challenging as high spatiotemporal resolution is required. Here, we present a new tracking-based method which can detect high frequency chromatin movement and quantify the mechanical dynamics of chromatin in live cells.

Results
We use this method to study how the mechanical properties of chromatin movement in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are modulated spatiotemporally during differentiation into cardiomyocytes (CM). Notably, we find that pluripotency is associated with a highly discrete, energy-dependent frequency of chromatin movement that we refer to as a ‘breathing’ state. We find that this ‘breathing’ state is strictly dependent on the metabolic state of the cell and is progressively silenced during differentiation.

Conclusions
We thus propose that the measured chromatin high frequency movements in hESCs may represent a hallmark of pluripotency and serve as a mechanism to maintain the genome in a transcriptionally accessible state. This is a result that could not have been observed without the high spatial and temporal resolution provided by this novel tracking method.},

The virus from the Filoviridae family causes hemorrhagic fever, which rapidly progresses and in some cases has a fatality rate near 90\%. The Ebola genome encodes seven genes, the most abundantly expressed of which is viral protein 40 (VP40), the major Ebola matrix protein that regulates assembly and egress of the virus. It is well established that VP40 assembles on the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane; however, the mechanistic details of plasma membrane association by VP40 are not well understood. In this study, we used an array of biophysical experiments and cellular assays along with mutagenesis of VP40 to investigate the role of membrane penetration in VP40 assembly and egress. Here we demonstrate that VP40 is able to penetrate specifically into the plasma membrane through an interface enriched in hydrophobic residues in its C-terminal domain. Mutagenesis of this hydrophobic region consisting of Leu213, Ile293, Leu295, and Val298 demonstrated that membrane penetration is critical to plasma membrane localization, VP40 oligomerization, and viral particle egress. Taken together, VP40 membrane penetration is an important step in the plasma membrane localization of the matrix protein where oligomerization and budding are defective in the absence of key hydrophobic interactions with the membrane.},

Traditionally the spectral shift of Laurdan’s emission from blue in the ordered lipid phase of the membrane (more rigid) toward green in the disordered lipid phase (more fluid) is quantified by the generalized polarization function. Here, we investigate the fluorescence lifetime of Laurdan at two different emission wavelengths and find that when the dipolar relaxation of Laurdan’s emission is spectrally isolated, analysis of the fluorescence decay can distinguish changes in membrane fluidity from changes in cholesterol content. Using the phasor representation to analyze changes in Laurdan’s fluorescence lifetime we obtain two different phasor trajectories for changes in polarity versus changes in cholesterol content. This gives us the ability to resolve in vivo membranes with different properties such as water content and cholesterol content and thus perform a more comprehensive analysis of cell membrane heterogeneity. We demonstrate this analysis in NIH3T3 cells using Laurdan as a biosensor to monitor changes in the membrane water content during cell migration.},

	abstract = {In renal proximal tubule (PT) cells, sodium-phosphate cotransporter IIa (NaPiIIa) is normally concentrated within the apical membrane where it reabsorbs ∼70\% of luminal phosphate (Pi). NaPiIIa activity is acutely regulated by moderating its abundance within the apical membrane. Under low-Pi conditions, NaPiIIa is retained within the apical membrane. Under high-Pi conditions, NaPiIIa is retrieved from the apical membrane and trafficked to the lysosomes for degradation. The present study investigates the role of Shank2 in regulating the distribution of NaPiIIa. In opossum kidney cells, a PT cell model, knockdown of Shank2 in cells maintained in low-Pi media resulted in a marked decrease in NaPiIIa abundance. After being transferred into high-Pi media, live-cell imaging showed that mRFP-Shank2E and GFP-NaPiIIa underwent endocytosis and trafficked together through the subapical domain. Fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy demonstrated that GFP-NaPiIIa and mRFP-Shank2 have indistinguishable diffusion coefficients and migrated through the subapical domain in temporal synchrony. Raster image cross-correlation spectroscopy demonstrated these two proteins course through the subapical domain in temporal-spatial synchrony. In the microvilli of cells under low-Pi conditions and in the subapical domain of cells under high-Pi conditions, fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy-Forster resonance energy transfer analysis of Cer-NaPiIIa and EYFP-Shank2E found these fluors reside within 10 nm of each other. Demonstrating a complexity of functions, in cells maintained under low-Pi conditions, Shank2 plays an essential role in the apical retention of NaPiIIa while under high-Pi conditions Shank2 remains associated with NaPiIIa and escorts NaPiIIa through the cell interior.},

FSS applied to endothelial cells (EC) triggers signaling events including opening of ion channels, activation of signaling pathways and changes in gene expression. Elucidating how ECs sense flow important for understanding both normal vascular function and disease. EC responses to FSS are mediated in part by a junctional mechanosensory complex consisting of VE-cadherin, PECAM-1, and VEGFR2 []. Previous work suggested that flow increases force on PECAM-1, which initiates signaling [–]. Deletion of PECAM-1 blocks responses to flow in vitro and flow-dependent vascular remodeling in vivo [, ]. To understand this process, we developed and validated FRET-based tension sensors for VE-cadherin and PECAM-1 using our previously developed FRET tension biosensor []. FRET measurements showed that in static culture, VE-cadherin in cell-cell junctions bears significant myosin-dependent tension, whereas there was no detectable tension on VE-cadherin outside of junctions. Onset of shear stress triggered a rapid ({\textless}30 sec) decrease in tension across VE-cadherin, which paralleled a decrease in total cell-cell junctional tension. Flow triggered a simultaneous increase in tension across junctional PECAM-1, while non-junctional PECAM-1 was unaffected. Tension on PECAM-1 was mediated by flow-stimulated association with vimentin. These data confirm the prediction that shear increases force on PECAM-1. However, they also argue against the current model of passive transfer of force through the cytoskeleton to the junctions [], showing instead that flow triggers cytoskeletal remodeling, which alters forces across the junctional receptors.},

So far this idea was probed by single-particle tracking of membrane components in which gold particles or antibodies were used to individually monitor the molecules of interest. Unfortunately, the relatively large particles needed for single-particle tracking can in principle alter the very dynamics under study. Here, we use a method that makes it possible to investigate plasma-membrane proteins by means of small molecular labels, specifically single GFP constructs. First, fast imaging of the region of interest on the membrane is performed. For each time delay in the resulting stack of images the average spatial correlation function is calculated. We show that by fitting the series of correlation functions, the actual protein “diffusion law” can be obtained directly from imaging, in the form of a mean-square displacement vs. time-delay plot, with no need for interpretative models. This approach is tested with several simulated 2D diffusion conditions and in live Chinese hamster ovary cells with a GFP-tagged transmembrane transferrin receptor, a well-known benchmark of membrane-skeleton–dependent transiently confined diffusion. This approach does not require extraction of the individual trajectories and can be used also with dim and dense molecules. We argue that it represents a powerful tool for the determination of kinetic and thermodynamic parameters over very wide spatial and temporal scales.},

Here we describe a practical implementation of multi-frequency widefield FD-FLIM using a pulsed supercontinuum laser and a direct digital synthesizer. In this instrument we use a pulse to modulate the image intensifier rather than the more conventional sine wave modulation. This allows parallel multi-frequency FLIM measurement using the Fast Fourier Transform and the cross-correlation technique, which permits precise and simultaneous isolation of individual frequencies. In addition, the pulse modulation at the cathode of image intensifier restored the loss of optical resolution caused by the defocusing effect when the voltage at the cathode is sinusoidally modulated. Furthermore, in our implementation of this technique, data can be graphically analyzed by the phasor method while data are acquired, which allows easy fit-free lifetime analysis of FLIM images. Here our measurements of standard fluorescent samples and a Föster resonance energy transfer pair demonstrate that the widefield multi-frequency FLIM system is a valuable and simple tool in fluorescence imaging studies.},

To achieve high sensitivity the design has two detection channels. Bacteria are stained by two different nucleic acid dyes and excited with two different lasers. Data are analyzed with a correlation filter based on particle passage pattern recognition. The passage of a particle through the illumination volume is compared with a Gaussian pattern in both channels. The width of the Gaussian correlates with the time of passage of the particle so one particle is counted when the algorithm finds a match with a Gaussian in both channels. The concentration of particles in the sample is deduced from the total number of coincident hits and the total volume scanned. This portable setup provides higher sensitivity, low cost and it could have a wide use ranging from clinical applications to pollution monitors and water and air quality control.},

Lipid-mediated delivery of DNA is hindered by extracellular and intracellular barriers that significantly reduce the transfection efficiency of synthetic nonviral vectors.

Results
In this study we investigated the role of the actin and microtubule networks on the uptake and cytoplasmic transport of multicomponent cationic liposome–DNA complexes in CHO-K1 live cells by means of confocal laser scanning microscopy and 3D single particle tracking. Treatment with actin (latrunculin B)- and microtubule-disrupting (nocodazole) reagents indicated that intracellular trafficking of complexes predominantly involves microtubule-dependent active transport. We found that the actin network has a major effect on the initial uptake of complexes, while the microtubule network is mainly responsible for the subsequent active transportation to the lysosomes.

Conclusion
Collectively, a strategy to improve the efficiency of lipid gene vectors can be formulated. We could find a lipid formulation that allows the nanoparticles to avoid the microtubule pathway to lysosomes.},

Methods such as fluorescent speckle microscopy and spatial temporal image correlation spectroscopy have been used to capture high-resolution actin turnover dynamics within cells in two dimensions. However, these methods are not directly applicable in 3D due to lower resolution and poor contrast. Here, we propose to capture actin flow in 3D with high spatial-temporal resolution by combining nanoscale precise imaging by rapid beam oscillation and fluctuation spectroscopy techniques. To measure the actin flow along cell protrusions in cell expressing actin-eGFP cultured in a type I collagen matrix, the laser was orbited around the protrusion and its trajectory was modulated in a clover-shaped pattern perpendicularly to the protrusion. Orbits were also alternated at two positions closely spaced along the protrusion axis. The pair cross-correlation function was applied to the fluorescence fluctuation from these two positions to capture the flow of actin. Measurements done on nonmoving cellular protrusion tips showed no pair-correlation at two orbital positions indicating a lack of flow of F-actin bundles. However, in some protrusions, the pair-correlation approach revealed directional flow of F-actin bundles near the protrusion surface with flow rates in the range of ∼1 μm/min, comparable to results in two dimensions using fluorescent speckle microscopy. Furthermore, we found that the actin flow rate is related to the distance to the protrusion tip. We also observed collagen deformation by concomitantly detecting collagen fibers with reflectance detection during these actin motions. The implementation of the nanoscale precise imaging by rapid beam oscillation method with a cloverleaf-shaped trajectory in conjunction with the pair cross-correlation function method provides a quantitative way of capturing dynamic flows and organization of proteins during cell migration in 3D in conditions of poor contrast.},

However, the effects of cigarette smoking on underlying brain activity in smokers with ADHD are not well characterized. Non-invasive Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) was used to characterize how cigarette smoking affects prefrontal brain hemodynamics in smokers with and without ADHD. Prefrontal changes of oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin (HbO2 and HHb) were measured in six male adult smokers with ADHD and six age- and gender-matched control smokers. NIRS measurements were separated into four sequential time intervals, i.e., before smoking, during smoking, after smoking, and during a breath hold. Prefrontal HbO2 was lower during smoking in smokers with ADHD compared to control smokers. More specifically, smokers with ADHD showed decreased prefrontal HbO2 during smoking compared to breath hold, before and after smoking periods. In contrast, control smokers showed increased prefrontal HbO2 from before smoking to breath hold. Decreased prefrontal HbO2 in smokers with ADHD may reflect a smoking-induced change in prefrontal brain activity and microvasculature, which is not found in smokers without ADHD. The lower prefrontal HbO2 may be a biomarker for increased susceptibility to tobacco smoke in smokers with ADHD. Smoking in individuals with ADHD may increase vasoconstriction of cerebral arteries in the prefrontal cortex, which may contribute to a reduction in HbO2. The findings highlight the importance of smoking cessation, in particular in those smokers who use nicotine to self-medicate ADHD symptoms.},

	abstract = {Background
Dynamin 2 (Dyn2) is a {\textasciitilde}100 kDa GTPase that assembles around the necks of nascent endocytic and Golgi vesicles and catalyzes membrane scission. Mutations in Dyn2 that cause Centronuclear Myopathy (CNM) have been shown to stabilize Dyn2 polymers against GTP-dependent disassembly in vitro. Precisely timed regulation of assembly and disassembly is believed to be critical for Dyn2 function in membrane vesiculation, and the CNM mutations interfere with this regulation by shifting the equilibrium toward the assembled state.

Methods
In this study we use two fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy (FFS) approaches to show that a CNM mutant form of Dyn2 also has a greater propensity to self-assemble in the cytosol and on the plasma membrane of living cells.

Results
Results obtained using brightness analysis indicate that unassembled wild-type Dyn2 is predominantly tetrameric in the cytosol, although different oligomeric species are observed, depending on the concentration of expressed protein. In contrast, an R369W mutant identified in CNM patients forms higher-order oligomers at concentrations above 1 μM. Investigation of Dyn2-R369W by Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) FFS reveals that this mutant forms larger and more stable clathrin-containing structures on the plasma membrane than wild-type Dyn2.

Conclusions and General Significance
These observations may explain defects in membrane trafficking reported in CNM patient cells and in heterologous systems expressing CNM-associated Dyn2 mutants.},

We demonstrate that with about 4,000 photon counts collected along a z-scan, axial localization precision close to 10 nm is achievable. We show that, with within 10 nm, the axial location of paxillin, FAK, and talin is similar at focal adhesion sites, while F-actin shows a sharp increase in height towards the cell center. We further demonstrated the live imaging capability of this method. With the advantage of simple data acquisition and no special instrument requirement, this approach could have wide dissemination and application potentials.},

	abstract = {Introduction
Radiographic density adversely affects the performance of X-ray mammography and can be particularly problematic in younger and high-risk women. Because of this limitation, there is significant ongoing effort to develop alternative cancer screening and detection strategies for this population. This pilot study evaluates the potential of Diffuse Optical Spectroscopic Imaging (DOSI) to image known tumors in dense breast tissue.

Methods
We performed a retrospective analysis on 24 radiographically dense breast cancer subjects measured with DOSI over a four-year period (Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System - BI-RADS, category 3 and 4, average age = 39 ± 7.6, average maximum size 31 ± 17 mm). Two previously-described DOSI contrast functions, the tissue optical index (TOI) and the specific tumor component (STC), which are based upon the concentrations and spectral signatures of hemoglobin, water and lipids, respectively, were used to form 2D optical images of breast tumors.

Results
Using TOI and STC, 21 out of 24 breast tumors were found to be statistically different from the surrounding highly vascularized dense tissue and to be distinguishable from the areolar region. For these patients, the tumor to normal contrast was 2.6 ± 1.2 (range 1.3 to 5.5) and 10.0 ± 7.5 (range 3.3 to 26.4) for TOI and STC, respectively. STC images were particularly useful in eliminating metabolic background from the retroareolar region which led to identification of two out of four retroareolar tumors.

Conclusions
Using both the abundance and the disposition of the tissue chromophores recovered from the DOSI measurements, we were able to observe tumor contrast relative to dense breast tissue. These preliminary results suggest that DOSI spectral characterization strategies may provide new information content that could help imaging breast tumors in radiographically dense tissue and in particular in the areolar complex.},

We show that in polarized MDCK cells, following sorting in the Golgi, each GPI-AP reaches the apical surface in homo-clusters. Golgi-derived homo-clusters are required for their subsequent plasma membrane organization into cholesterol-dependent hetero-clusters. By contrast, in non-polarized MDCK cells GPI-APs are delivered to the surface as monomers in an unpolarized manner and are not able to form hetero-clusters. We further demonstrate that this GPI-AP organization is regulated by the content of cholesterol in the Golgi apparatus and is required to maintain the functional state of the protein at the apical membrane. Thus, different from fibroblasts, in polarized epithelial cells a selective cholesterol-dependent sorting mechanism in the Golgi regulates both the organization and the function of GPI-APs at the apical surface.},

However, much less is known about the dynamic association of these proteins in the 3D microenvironment. Limited imaging technologies capable of measuring protein interactions in real time and space for cells grown in 3D is a major impediment in understanding how proteins function under different environmental cues. In this study, we applied the nano-scale precise imaging by rapid beam oscillation (nSPIRO) technique and combined the scaning-fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (sFCS) and the number and molecular brightness (N\&B) methods to investigate paxillin and actin dynamics at focal adhesions in 3D. Both MDA-MB-231 cells and U2OS cells produce elongated protrusions with high intensity regions of paxillin in cell grown in 3D collagen matrices. Using sFCS we found higher percentage of slow diffusing proteins at these focal spots, suggesting assembling/disassembling processes. In addition, the N\&B analysis shows paxillin aggregated predominantly at these focal contacts which are next to collagen fibers. At those sites, actin showed slower apparent diffusion rate, which indicated that actin is either polymerizing or binding to the scaffolds in these locals. Our findings demonstrate that by multiplexing these techniques we have the ability to spatially and temporally quantify focal adhesion assembly and disassembly in 3D space and allow the understanding tumor cell invasion in a more complex relevant environment.},

By pair correlation analysis of EGFP molecular flow into chromatin before and after damage, this assay measures millisecond variations in chromatin compaction with submicron resolution. Combined with laser microirradiation we employ this assay to monitor the real-time accessibility of DNA at the damage site. We find from comparison of EGFP molecular flow with a molecule that has an affinity toward double-strand breaks (Ku-EGFP) that DNA damage induces a transient decrease in chromatin compaction at the damage site and an increase in compaction to adjacent regions, which together facilitate DNA repair factor recruitment to the lesion with high spatiotemporal control.},

	abstract = {Background
A complex network of putative molecular interactions underlies the architecture and function of cell-matrix adhesions. Most of these interactions are implicated from co-immunoprecipitation studies using expressed components; but few have been demonstrated or characterized functionally in living cells.

Results
We introduce fluorescence fluctuation methods to determine, at high spatial and temporal resolution, ‘when’ and ‘where’ molecular complexes form and their stoichiometry in nascent adhesions (NAs). We focus on integrin-associated molecules implicated in integrin-activation and in the integrin-actin linkage in NAs and show that these molecules form integrin containing complexes hierarchically within the adhesion itself. Integrin and kindlin reside in a molecular complex as soon as adhesions are visible; talin, while also present early, associates with the integrin-kindlin complex only after NAs have formed and in response to myosin II activity. Furthermore, talin and vinculin association precedes the formation of the integrin-talin complex. Finally, α-actinin enters NAs periodically and in clusters that transiently associate with integrins. The absolute number and stoichiometry of these molecules varies among the molecules studied and changes as adhesions mature.

Conclusions
These observations suggest a working model for NA assembly, whereby transient α-actinin- integrin complexes help nucleate NAs within the lamellipodium. Subsequently integrin complexes containing kindlin, but not talin, emerge. Once NAs have formed, myosin II activity promotes talin association with the integrin-kindlin complex in a stoichiometry consistent with each talin molecule linking two integrin-kindlin complexes.},

Using biochemical assays and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) to probe metabolism in vitro and in living tumors, we observe that interference with Wnt signaling in colon cancer cells reduces glycolytic metabolism and results in small, poorly perfused tumors. We identify pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1) as an important direct target within a larger gene program for metabolism. PDK1 inhibits pyruvate flux to mitochondrial respiration and a rescue of its expression in Wnt-inhibited cancer cells rescues glycolysis as well as vessel growth in the tumor microenvironment. Thus, we identify an important mechanism by which Wnt-driven Warburg metabolism directs the use of glucose for cancer cell proliferation and links it to vessel delivery of oxygen and nutrients.},

The EBOV genome consists of negative sense RNA that encodes seven proteins including viral protein 40 (VP40). VP40 is the major Ebola virus matrix protein and regulates assembly and egress of infectious Ebola virus particles. It is well established that VP40 assembles on the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane of human cells to regulate viral budding where VP40 can produce virus like particles (VLPs) without other Ebola virus proteins present. The mechanistic details, however, of VP40 lipid-interactions and protein-protein interactions that are important for viral release remain to be elucidated. Here, we mutated a loop region in the N-terminal domain of VP40 (Lys127, Thr129, and Asn130) and find that mutations (K127A, T129A, and N130A) in this loop region reduce plasma membrane localization of VP40. Additionally, using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy and number and brightness analysis we demonstrate these mutations greatly reduce VP40 oligomerization. Lastly, VLP assays demonstrate these mutations significantly reduce VLP release from cells. Taken together, these studies identify an important loop region in VP40 that may be essential to viral egress.},

This is the first demonstration of leveraging the plasmons in such hybrid nanostructures by metal enhanced fluorescence (MEF) in the near-infrared wavelengths. We observed more than three orders of magnitude enhancement in the fluorescence signal of a single molecule of goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate, FITC, (FITC-IgG) by two-photon excitation with these structures. These large enhancements in the fluorescence signal at the nanoscale gaps between the composite wrinkles corresponded to shortened lifetimes due to localized surface plasmons. To characterize these structures, we combined fluctuation correlation spectroscopy (FCS), fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM), and two-photon microscopy to spatially and temporally map the hot spots with high resolution.},

From a stack of camera images recorded in seconds, the type of dynamics such as free diffusion, flow or binding can be identified and quantified without being limited by current camera frame rates. Also, light exposure levels are very low and the image mean square displacement method does not require calibration of the microscope point spread function. To demonstrate the advantages of our approach, we quantified the dynamics of several different proteins in the cyto- and nucleoplasm of living cells. For example, from a single measurement, we were able to determine the diffusion coefficient of free clathrin molecules as well as the transport velocity of clathrin-coated vesicles involved in endocytosis. Used in conjunction with dual view detection, we further show how protein-protein interactions can be quantified.},

However, none of these methods enables us to measure the diffusion of the fluorescent particle at each pixel of the image. Measurement using conventional single-point FCS at every individual pixel results in continuous long exposure of the cell to the laser and eventual bleaching of the sample. To overcome this limitation, we have developed what we believe to be a new method of scanning with simultaneous construction of a fluorescent image of the cell. In this believed new method of modified raster scanning, as it acquires the image, the laser scans each individual line multiple times before moving to the next line. This continues until the entire area is scanned. This is different from the original raster-scan image correlation spectroscopy approach, where data are acquired by scanning each frame once and then scanning the image multiple times. The total time of data acquisition needed for this method is much shorter than the time required for traditional FCS analysis at each pixel. However, at a single pixel, the acquired intensity time sequence is short; requiring nonconventional analysis of the correlation function to extract information about the diffusion. These correlation data have been analyzed using the phasor approach, a fit-free method that was originally developed for analysis of FLIM images. Analysis using this method results in an estimation of the average diffusion coefficient of the fluorescent species at each pixel of an image, and thus, a detailed diffusion map of the cell can be created.},

The method is based on a feedback algorithm that controls the hardware of a two-photon laser scanning microscope in order to perform a circular orbit around the object to be tracked: the feedback mechanism will maintain the fluorescent object in the center by controlling the displacement of the scanning beam3-5. To demonstrate the advantages of this technique, we followed a fast moving organelle, the lysosome, within a living cell6,7. Cells were plated according to standard protocols, and stained using a commercially lysosome dye. We discuss briefly the hardware configuration and in more detail the control software, to perform a 3D orbital tracking experiment inside living cells. We discuss in detail the parameters required in order to control the scanning microscope and enable the motion of the beam in a closed orbit around the particle. We conclude by demonstrating how this method can be effectively used to track the fast motion of a labeled lysosome along microtubules in 3D within a live cell. Lysosomes can move with speeds in the range of 0.4-0.5 µm/sec, typically displaying a directed motion along the microtubule network8.},

Theoretical models provide explanations for this effect but with predictions that drastically depend on the nanoscale organization assumed for macromolecular crowding agents. A conclusive test of the nature of the translational motion in cells is missing owing to the lack of techniques capable of probing crowding with the required temporal and spatial resolution. Here we show that fluorescence-fluctuation analysis of raster scans at variable timescales can provide this information. By using green fluorescent proteins in cells, we measure protein motion at the unprecedented timescale of 1 μs, unveiling unobstructed Brownian motion from 25 to 100 nm, and partially suppressed diffusion above 100 nm. Furthermore, experiments on model systems attribute this effect to the presence of relatively immobile structures rather than to diffusing crowding agents. We discuss the implications of these results for intracellular processes., 
Models for protein diffusion in cells assume a large macromolecular crowding effect. Here Di Rienzo et al. visualize GFP diffusion at the millisecond timescale to observe unobstructed Brownian motion in mammalian cells for distances up to 100 nm, revealing minimal influence of macromolecular crowding.},

We used a sensitive, non-invasive method to detect metabolic oscillations and circadian phase within epidermal stem cells in live mice at the single cell level. We observe a higher NADH/NAD+ ratio, reflecting an increased glycolysis/oxidative phosphorylation ratio, during the night compared to the day. Furthermore, we demonstrate that single cell metabolic heterogeneity within the basal cell layer correlates with the circadian clock and that diurnal fluctuations in NADH/NAD+ ratio are Bmal1 dependent.

Here by employing high-speed 3D fluorescence nanoimaging techniques we resolve and track at the single cell level multiple, distinct regions of mRNA synthesis within the model system of a large transgene array. We demonstrate that these regions are active transcription sites that release mRNA molecules in the nucleoplasm. Using fluctuation spectroscopy and the phasor analysis approach we were able to extract the local PolII elongation rate at each site as a function of time. We measured a four-fold variation in the average elongation between identical copies of the same gene measured simultaneously within the same cell, demonstrating a correlation between local transcription kinetics and the movement of the transcription site. Together these observations demonstrate that local factors, such as chromatin local mobility and the microenvironment of the transcription site, are an important source of transcription kinetics variability.},

In our study total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy images were taken of Cholera toxin subunit B (CtxB) membrane-labeled NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts and MDA 231 MB cells. We found a population of CTxB undergoing purely isotropic diffusion and one displaying restricted diffusion with corral sizes ranging from 150 to ∼1800 nm. We show that the diffusion rate of CTxB bound to GM1 is independent of the size of the confinement, suggesting that the mechanism of confinement is different from the mechanism controlling the diffusion rate of CtxB. We highlight the potential effect of continuous illumination on the diffusion mode of CTxB.

The nanoscale spatial distribution of the molecules inside the detection volume of a scanning microscope can be encoded within the fluorescence dynamics and decoded by resolving the signal into its dynamics components. Here we present a robust and general method to decode this information using phasor analysis. As an example of the application of this method, we optically generate spatially controlled gradients in the fluorescence lifetime by stimulated emission. Spatial resolution can be increased indefinitely by increasing the number of resolved dynamics components up to a maximum determined by the amount of noise. We demonstrate that the proposed method provides nanoscale imaging of subcellular structures, opening new routes in super-resolution microscopy based on the encoding/decoding of spatial information through manipulation of molecular dynamics., 
Increasing the resolution of fluorescence microscopy is a fundamental need for modern cell biology. Lanzanò et al. demonstrate that arbitrary spatial resolution is, in principle, possible by encoding the fluorophore's spatial distribution information in the temporal dynamics of the fluorophore's transition.},

In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, these domains are structured by scaffolds composed mainly by two cytoplasmic proteins Pil1 and Lsp1. Eisosomes are immobile domains, have relatively uniform size, and encompass thousands of units of the core proteins Pil1 and Lsp1. In this work we used fluorescence fluctuation analytical methods to determine the dynamics of eisosome core proteins at different subcellular locations. Using a combination of scanning techniques with autocorrelation analysis, we show that Pil1 and Lsp1 cytoplasmic pools freely diffuse whereas an eisosome-associated fraction of these proteins exhibits slow dynamics that fit with a binding-unbinding equilibrium. Number and brightness analysis shows that the eisosome-associated fraction is oligomeric, while cytoplasmic pools have lower aggregation states. Fluorescence lifetime imaging results indicate that Pil1 and Lsp1 directly interact in the cytoplasm and within the eisosomes. These results support a model where Pil1-Lsp1 heterodimers are the minimal eisosomes building blocks. Moreover, individual-eisosome fluorescence fluctuation analysis shows that eisosomes in the same cell are not equal domains: while roughly half of them are mostly static, the other half is actively exchanging core protein subunits.},

	abstract = {The role of specific phospholipids (PLs) in lipid transport has been difficult to assess due to an inability to selectively manipulate membrane composition in vivo. Here we show that the phospholipid remodeling enzyme lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 3 (Lpcat3) is a critical determinant of triglyceride (TG) secretion due to its unique ability to catalyze the incorporation of arachidonate into membranes. Mice lacking Lpcat3 in the intestine fail to thrive during weaning and exhibit enterocyte lipid accumulation and reduced plasma TGs. Mice lacking Lpcat3 in the liver show reduced plasma TGs, hepatosteatosis, and secrete lipid-poor very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) lacking arachidonoyl PLs. Mechanistic studies indicate that Lpcat3 activity impacts membrane lipid mobility in living cells, suggesting a biophysical basis for the requirement of arachidonoyl PLs in lipidating lipoprotein particles. These data identify Lpcat3 as a key factor in lipoprotein production and illustrate how manipulation of membrane composition can be used as a regulatory mechanism to control metabolic pathways., DOI:
http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06557.001, Living cells are surrounded by a membrane that forms a barrier between the cell and its external environment. This membrane is largely made up of a variety of molecules known as lipids. The particular lipid molecules found in a cell membrane strongly influence its mobility, flexibility and other physical properties., The liver and intestine can package lipids gained from the diet into molecules called lipoproteins, which are released into the bloodstream for use by the body. An enzyme known as Lpcat3 is found in high levels in the liver and intestine and it appears to be involved in the production of lipoproteins. Altering the amount of Lpcat3 in cells can change the types of lipids found in the cell membranes, connected to the production of lipoproteins., Rong et al. studied newborn mice that were missing the Lpcat3 protein in either the liver or intestine. Mice lacking Lpcat3 in the intestine had higher levels of lipids inside their intestine cells and grew more slowly than normal mice. Mice lacking Lpcat3 in the liver also accumulated lipids in their cells and their bloodstream had lower levels of lipids that contain a molecule called arachidonic acid than normal mice. Further experiments showed that the loss of Lpcat3 reduces the ability of lipids to move within the cell membrane., The experiments show that Lpcat3 plays a key role in attaching arachidonic acid to membrane lipids to promote the release of lipoproteins into the bloodstream. Rong et al.'s findings reveal that changing the type of lipids in the cell membrane plays an important role in regulating the levels of lipids in the blood., DOI:

Here we present a global spectral phasor analysis method which allows investigations of NRs' spectra at single particle level with their statistic behavior and spatial information during imaging. The wide phasor distribution obtained by the spectral phasor analysis indicates spectra of NRs are different from particle to particle. NRs with different spectra can be identified graphically in corresponding spatial images with high spectral resolution. Furthermore, spectral behaviors of NRs under different imaging conditions, e.g. different excitation powers and wavelengths, were carefully examined by our laser-scanning multiphoton microscope with spectral imaging capability. Our results prove that the spectral phasor method is an easy and efficient tool in hyper-spectral imaging analysis to unravel subtle changes of the emission spectrum. Moreover, we applied this method to study the spectral dynamics of NRs during direct optical trapping and by optothermal trapping. Interestingly, spectral shifts were observed in both trapping phenomena.},

While on the glass surface, we observed the presence in the emission at least 3 components: i) second harmonic signal (SHG), ii) a broad emission from AuNPS and iii) fluorescence arising from fluorophores nearby. When on the glass surface, we found that the 3 spectral components have different relative intensities when the incident direction of linear polarization was changed indicating different physical origins for these components. Then we measured by fluctuation correlation spectroscopy (FCS) the scattering and fluorescence signal of the particles alone and in a solution of 100 nM EGFP using the spectral camera or measuring the scattering and fluorescence from the particles. We observed occasional fluorescence bursts when in the suspension we added fluorescent proteins. The spectrum of these burst was devoid of the SHG and of the broad emission in contrast to the signal collected from the gold nanoparticles on the glass surface. Instead we found that the spectrum during the burst corresponded closely to the spectrum of the fluorescent protein. An additional control was obtained by measuring the cross-correlation between the reflection from the particles and the fluorescence arising from EGFP both excited at 488 nm. We found a very weak cross-correlation between the AuNPs and the fluorescence confirming that the burst originate from a few particles with a fluorescence signal.},

oxidative stress. To corroborate our hypothesis that these species are products of
lipid oxidation by ROS, we correlate the spectroscopic signals arising from lipid
droplets by combining FLIM with THG and CARS microscopy which are established
techniques for selective lipid body imaging. Further, we performed spontaneous Raman
spectral analysis at single points of the sample which provided molecular vibration

	abstract = {α-Synuclein (aS) aggregation has been amply investigated for
its involvement in Parkinson’s disease because its amyloid fibrils are the
main constituent of Lewy bodies, one of the hallmarks of the disease. aS aggregation
was studied here in vitro and in cellular models to correlate
aggregation products with toxicity mechanisms. Independent results published
elsewhere suggested that aS overexpression and/or aggregation may impair cellular
metabolism and cause mitochondrial damage. In this context, we report the
characterization of changes in NADH fluorescence properties in vitro
and in human embryonic kidney 293 cells upon aS aggregation. The application of the
phasor approach to study NADH fluorescence lifetime and emission allowed us to
identify changes that correlate with aS aggregation. In particular, the fraction of
bound NADH, characterized by longer lifetimes in comparison to free NADH, is
increased, and the maximum of the NADH emission is shifted toward shorter wavelengths
in the presence of aggregating aS both in vitro and in cells. These
data suggest that NADH binds to aggregated aS. NMR experiments in
vitro substantiate such binding, which occurs during aggregation. NADH
fluorescence is thus useful to detect aS aggregation and by extension the associated
oxidative stress.—Plotegher, N., Stringari, C., Jahid, S., Veronesi, M.,

However, due to the fast dynamics and the tiny structures involved, a very high spatio-temporal resolution is required to catch the real behavior of molecules. Here we present the experimental protocol for studying the dynamics of fluorescently-labeled plasma-membrane proteins and lipids in live cells with high spatiotemporal resolution. Notably, this approach doesn’t need to track each molecule, but it calculates population behavior using all molecules in a given region of the membrane. The starting point is a fast imaging of a given region on the membrane. Afterwards, a complete spatio-temporal autocorrelation function is calculated correlating acquired images at increasing time delays, for example each 2, 3, n repetitions. It is possible to demonstrate that the width of the peak of the spatial autocorrelation function increases at increasing time delay as a function of particle movement due to diffusion. Therefore, fitting of the series of autocorrelation functions enables to extract the actual protein mean square displacement from imaging (iMSD), here presented in the form of apparent diffusivity vs average displacement. This yields a quantitative view of the average dynamics of single molecules with nanometer accuracy. By using a GFP-tagged variant of the Transferrin Receptor (TfR) and an ATTO488 labeled 1-palmitoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (PPE) it is possible to observe the spatiotemporal regulation of protein and lipid diffusion on µm-sized membrane regions in the micro-to-milli-second time range.},

	abstract = {The Wnts are secreted, lipidated glycoproteins that play a role in cellular processes of differentiation, proliferation, migration, survival, polarity and stem cell self-renewal. The majority of Wnts biological effects are through binding to specific frizzled (Fzd) receptor complexes leading to activation of downstream pathways. Secreted Frizzled-related proteins (sFRPs) were first identified as antagonists of Wnt signalling by binding directly to Wnts. They comprise two domains, a Fzd-like cysteine rich domain (CRD) and a netrin-like domain (NLD). Subsequently sFRPs have been shown to also interact with Fzd receptors and more diverse functions have been identified, including potentiation of Wnt signalling. Many aspects of the biology of this family remain to be elucidated. We used the number and brightness (N\&B) method, a technique based on fluorescence fluctuation analysis, to characterise the intracellular aggregation and trafficking of sFRP4 domains. We expressed sFRP4 and its’ domains as EGFP fusions and then characterised the effect of endogenous Wnt3a by fluorescence confocal imaging. We observed vesicular trafficking of sFRP4 and that the NLD domain has a vesicular association signal. We found that sFRP4 and the CRD formed oligomeric aggregates in the perinuclear region while the NLD was distributed evenly throughout the cell with a larger proportion of aggregates. Most significantly we observed intracellular redistribution of sFRP4 in response to Wnt3a suggesting that Wnt3a can modulate intracellular localisation and secretion of sFRP4. Our results reveal a number of novel findings regarding sFRP4 which are likely to have relevance to this wider family.},

The molecular basis for their anti-inflammatory effects is incompletely understood, but has been proposed to involve the indirect tethering of LXRs to inflammatory gene promoters. Here we demonstrate that the ability of LXRs to repress inflammatory gene expression in cells and mice derives primarily from their ability to regulate lipid metabolism through transcriptional activation and can occur in the absence of SUMOylation. Moreover, we identify the putative lipid transporter Abca1 as a critical mediator of LXR's anti-inflammatory effects. Activation of LXR inhibits signaling from TLRs 2, 4 and 9 to their downstream NF-κB and MAPK effectors through Abca1-dependent changes in membrane lipid organization that disrupt the recruitment of MyD88 and TRAF6. These data suggest that a common mechanism-direct transcriptional activation-underlies the dual biological functions of LXRs in metabolism and inflammation., DOI:
http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08009.001, Inflammation is a normal part of the immune response to infection or tissue damage. However, increased inflammation has been linked to diseases such as obesity, diabetes and atherosclerosis (in which the walls of the arteries become hardened). These same diseases have also been linked to problems with the production or breakdown of fatty molecules, such as cholesterol., Transcription factors are proteins that bind to DNA to control gene expression. A transcription factor called LXR regulates the production and breakdown of cholesterol in response to changing levels of cholesterol in the body. LXR has also been shown to inhibit inflammatory responses, but previous studies suggested that these two actions of LXR are independent of each other., Ito et al. have now challenged these findings by showing that LXR inhibits inflammation via changes in the metabolism of cholesterol and other fatty molecules. The experiments used genetically engineered immune cells, called macrophages, and mice to show that activating LXR causes cholesterol molecules to move between the membranes in a cell. This in turn leads to changes in the signals sent by proteins found at the cell surface, and eventually to a reduction of inflammation responses., Future work will focus on better understanding the link between LXR's effects on metabolism and inflammation in models of human diseases such as diabetes and atherosclerosis., DOI:

Single cells in a dish can be conveniently imaged using an upright/inverted configuration. However, for measurements on long time scales (hours to days), mechanical drift is a problem; especially for studies of mammalian cells that typically require heating to 37°C which causes a thermal gradient across the instrument. Since the light sheet diverges towards the edges of the field of view, such a drift leads to a decrease in axial resolution over time. Or, even worse, the specimen could move out of the imaging volume. Here, we present a simple, cost-effective way to stabilize the axial position using the microscope camera to track the sample position. Thereby, sample loss is prevented and an optimal axial resolution is maintained by keeping the sample at the position where the light sheet is at its thinnest. We demonstrate the virtue of our approach by measurements of the light sheet thickness and 3D time lapse imaging of a cell monolayer at physiological conditions.},

As consequence of playing a structural role in heterochromatin, HP1 proteins can have both an activating as well as repressive function in gene expression.

We find from fluctuation analysis of HP1-α dynamics that this isoform exists as a dimer around the periphery of heterochromatin foci and these foci locally rotate with characteristic turn rates that range from 5–100ms. From inhibition of HP1-α homo-oligomerization we find the slow turn rates (20–100 ms) are dimer dependent. From treatment with drugs that disrupt or promote chromatin compaction, we find that HP1-α dimers spatially redistribute to favor fast (5–10 ms) or slow (20–100 ms) turn rates. Collectively our results demonstrate HP1-α oligomerization is critical to the maintenance of heterochromatin and the tunable dynamics of this HP1 isoform.},

In this paper, we analyzed the cytosolic HIV-1 Gag fraction in real time in live cells using advanced fluctuation imaging methods and thereby provide detailed insights into the complex relationship between cytosolic Gag mobility, stoichiometry, and interactions. We show that Gag diffuses as a monomer on the subsecond timescale with severely reduced mobility. Reduction of mobility is associated with basic residues in its nucleocapsid (NC) domain, whereas capsid (CA) and matrix (MA) domains do not contribute significantly. Strikingly, another diffusive Gag species was observed on the seconds timescale that oligomerized in a concentration-dependent manner. Both NC- and CA-mediated interactions strongly assist this process. Our results reveal potential nucleation steps of cytosolic Gag fractions before membrane-assisted Gag assembly.},

Ebola virus, which buds from the plasma membrane of the host cell, causes viral hemorrhagic fever and has a high fatality rate. To date, little has been known about how budding and egress of Ebola virus are mediated at the plasma membrane. We have found that the lipid phosphatidylserine (PS) regulates the assembly of Ebola virus matrix protein VP40. VP40 binds PS-containing membranes with nanomolar affinity, and binding of PS regulates VP40 localization and oligomerization on the plasma membrane inner leaflet. Further, alteration of PS levels in mammalian cells inhibits assembly and egress of VP40. Notably, interactions of VP40 with the plasma membrane induced exposure of PS on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane at sites of egress, whereas PS is typically found only on the inner leaflet. Taking the data together, we present a model accounting for the role of plasma membrane PS in assembly of Ebola virus-like particles., IMPORTANCE The lipid-enveloped Ebola virus causes severe infection with a high mortality rate and currently lacks FDA-approved therapeutics or vaccines. Ebola virus harbors just seven genes in its genome, and there is a critical requirement for acquisition of its lipid envelope from the plasma membrane of the human cell that it infects during the replication process. There is, however, a dearth of information available on the required contents of this envelope for egress and subsequent attachment and entry. Here we demonstrate that plasma membrane phosphatidylserine is critical for Ebola virus budding from the host cell plasma membrane. This report, to our knowledge, is the first to highlight the role of lipids in human cell membranes in the Ebola virus replication cycle and draws a clear link between selective binding and transport of a lipid across the membrane of the human cell and use of that lipid for subsequent viral entry.},

DNA lipoplexes formed from DNA with a range of 21 bp to 5.5 kbp exhibited a similar range of motion within the cytoplasm of myoblast cells regardless of size. However, the rate of motion was dictated by the intracellular location, and DNA cluster size. This analysis demonstrated that the different transport mechanisms either had a size dependent mobility, including random diffusion, whereas other mechanisms were not influenced by the DNA size such as active transport. The transport mechanisms identified followed a spatial dependence comparable to viral trafficking of non-active transport mechanism upon cellular entry, active transport within the cytoplasm and further inactive transportation along the peri-nuclear region.

	abstract = {Rho GTPases play important roles in many aspects of cell migration, including polarity establishment and organizing actin cytoskeleton. In particular, the Rho GTPase Rac1 has been associated with the generation of protrusions at leading edge of migrating cells. Previously we showed the mobility of Rac1 molecules is not uniform throughout a migrating cell (Hinde E et. al. PNAS 2013). Specifically, the closer a Rac1 molecule is to the leading edge, the slower the molecule diffuses. Because actin-bound Rac1 diffuses slower than unbound Rac1, we hypothesized that regions of high actin concentration, called “actin islands”, act as diffusive traps and are responsible for the non-uniform diffusion observed in vivo. Here, in silico model simulations demonstrate that equally spaced actin islands can regulate the time scale for Rac1 diffusion in a manner consistent with data from live-cell imaging experiments. Additionally, we find this mechanism is robust; different patterns of Rac1 mobility can be achieved by changing the actin islands’ positions or their affinity for Rac1.},

However, the complexity and high costs involved in construction of such a system limit the extensive use of this technique. PCO AG recently released the first luminescence lifetime imaging camera based on a high frequency modulated CMOS image sensor, QMFLIM2. Here we tested and provide operational procedures to calibrate the camera and to improve the accuracy using corrections necessary for image analysis. With its flexible input/output options, we are able to use a modulated laser diode or a 20MHz pulsed white supercontinuum laser as the light source. The output of the camera consists of a stack of modulated images that can be analyzed by the SimFCS software using the phasor approach. The non-uniform system response across the image sensor must be calibrated at the pixel level. This pixel calibration is crucial and needed for every camera settings, e.g. modulation frequency and exposure time. A significant dependency of the modulation signal on the intensity was also observed and hence an additional calibration is needed for each pixel depending on the pixel intensity level. These corrections are important not only for the fundamental frequency, but also for the higher harmonics when using the pulsed supercontinuum laser. With these post data acquisition corrections, the PCO CMOS-FLIM camera can be used for various biomedical applications requiring a large frame and high speed acquisition.},

Here we demonstrate that the LXR-responsive phospholipid-remodeling enzyme Lpcat3 modulates intestinal fatty acid and cholesterol absorption and is required for survival on a high-fat diet. Mice lacking Lpcat3 in the intestine thrive on carbohydrate-based chow, but lose body weight rapidly and become moribund on a triglyceride-rich diet. Lpcat3-dependent incorporation of polyunsaturated fatty acids into phospholipids is required for the efficient transport of dietary lipids into enterocytes. Furthermore, loss of Lpcat3 amplifies the production of gut hormones including GLP-1 and oleoylethanolamide in response to high-fat feeding, contributing to the paradoxical cessation of food intake in the setting of starvation. These results reveal that membrane phospholipid composition is a gating factor in passive lipid absorption, and implicate LXR-Lpcat3 signaling in a gut-brain feedback loop that couples absorption to food intake.,},

We use this method to demonstrate a dependence of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) mobility on oligomeric state. We find that on entering the nucleus STAT3 dimers must first bind DNA to form STAT3 tetramers, which are also DNA-bound but exhibit a different mobility signature. Examining the dimer-to-tetramer transition by a cross-pair correlation analysis (cpCOMB) reveals that chromatin accessibility modulates STAT3 tetramer formation. Thus, the pCOMB approach is suitable for mapping the impact oligomerization on transcription factor dynamics.,

Using fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) and phasor analysis to measure endogenous retinoic acid (RA) directly in vivo, we have investigated the amplitude of noise in RA signaling, and how modulation of this noise affects patterning of hindbrain segments (rhombomeres) in the zebrafish embryo. We demonstrate that RA forms a noisy gradient during critical stages of hindbrain patterning and that cells use distinct intracellular binding proteins to attenuate noise in RA levels. Increasing noise disrupts sharpening of rhombomere boundaries and proper patterning of the hindbrain. These findings reveal novel cellular mechanisms of noise regulation, which are likely to play important roles in other aspects of physiology and disease., DOI:
http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14034.001, Animal cells need to be able to communicate with each other so that they can work together in tissues and organs. To do so, cells release signaling molecules that can move around within a tissue and be detected by receptors on other cells., We tend to assume that the signaling molecules are evenly distributed across a tissue and affect all the receiving cells in the same way. However, random variations (noise) that affect how many of these molecules are produced, how they move through the space between cells and how they bind to receptors makes the reality much more complex. Cells responding to the signal somehow can ignore this noise and establish sharp boundaries between different cell types so that neighboring cells have distinct roles in the tissue. Few studies have attempted to measure such noise or address how cells manage to respond to noisy signals in a consistent manner., Retinoic acid is a signaling molecule that plays an important role in the development of the brain in animal embryos. It forms a gradient along the body of the embryo from the head end to the tail end, but it has proved difficult to measure this gradient directly. Sosnik et al. exploited the fact that this molecule is weakly fluorescent and used microscopy to directly detect it in zebrafish embryos. The experiments show that retinoic acid forms a gradient in the embryos, with high levels at the tail end and lower levels at the head end., Sosnik et al. also found that there is a large amount of noise in the retinoic acid gradient. Two cells in the same position can have very different retinoic acid levels, and the levels in a particular cell can vary from one minute to the next. The experiments also show that proteins that interact with retinoic acid help to reduce noise within a cell. This noise reduction is important for sharpening the boundaries between different brain regions in the embryo to allow the brain to develop normally. A future challenge will be to see if similar retinoic acid gradients and noise control occur in other tissues, and if the noise has any positive role to play in development., DOI:

	doi = {10.1186/s40170-016-0148-6},
	abstract = {Background
The majority of cancer cells have a unique metabolic requirement for methionine that is not observed in normal, non-tumorigenic cells. This phenotype is described as “methionine dependence” or “methionine stress sensitivity” in which cancer cells are unable to proliferate when methionine has been replaced with its metabolic precursor, homocysteine, in cell culture growth media. We focus on the metabolic response to methionine stress in the triple negative breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-468 and its methionine insensitive derivative cell line MDA-MB-468res-R8.

Results
Using a variety of techniques including fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) and extracellular flux assays, we identified a metabolic down-regulation of oxidative phosphorylation in both MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-468res-R8 cell types when cultured in homocysteine media. Untargeted metabolomics was performed by way of gas chromatography/time-of-flight mass spectrometry on both cell types cultured in homocysteine media over a period of 2 to 24 h. We determined unique metabolic responses between the two cell lines in specific pathways including methionine salvage, purine/pyrimidine synthesis, and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Stable isotope tracer studies using deuterium-labeled homocysteine indicated a redirection of homocysteine metabolism toward the transsulfuration pathway and glutathione synthesis. This data corroborates with increased glutathione levels concomitant with increased levels of oxidized glutathione. Redirection of homocysteine flux resulted in reduced generation of methionine from homocysteine particularly in MDA-MB-468 cells. Consequently, synthesis of the important one-carbon donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) was decreased, perturbing the SAM to S-adenosylhomocysteine ratio in MDA-MB-468 cells, which is an indicator of the cellular methylation potential.

Conclusion
This study indicates a differential metabolic response between the methionine sensitive MDA-MB-468 cells and the methionine insensitive derivative cell line MDA-MB-468res-R8. Both cell lines appear to experience oxidative stress when methionine was replaced with its metabolic precursor homocysteine, forcing cells to redirect homocysteine metabolism toward the transsulfuration pathway to increase glutathione synthesis. The methionine stress resistant MDA-MB-468res-R8 cells responded to this cellular stress earlier than the methionine stress sensitive MDA-MB468 cells and coped better with metabolic demands. Additionally, it is evident that S-adenosylmethionine metabolism is dependent on methionine availability in cancer cells, which cannot be sufficiently supplied by homocysteine metabolism under these conditions.},

Despite this, a satisfactory mechanism-based explanation of their superior efficacy has remained mostly elusive thus far. Here we apply a straightforward combination of live cell imaging, single-particle tracking microscopy, and quantitative transfection-efficiency assays on live cells to unveil the intracellular trafficking mechanism of Lipofectamine/DNA complexes. We find that Lipofectamine, contrary to alternative formulations, is able to efficiently avoid active intracellular transport along microtubules, and the subsequent entrapment and degradation of the payload within acidic/digestive lysosomal compartments. This result is achieved by random Brownian motion of Lipofectamine-containing vesicles within the cytoplasm. We demonstrate here that Brownian diffusion is an efficient route for Lipofectamine/DNA complexes to avoid metabolic degradation, thus leading to optimal transfection. By contrast, active transport along microtubules results in DNA degradation and subsequent poor transfection. Intracellular trafficking, endosomal escape and lysosomal degradation appear therefore as highly interdependent phenomena, in such a way that they should be viewed as a single barrier on the route for efficient transfection. As a matter of fact, they should be evaluated in their entirety for the development of optimized non-viral gene delivery vectors.},

Optical characterization studies attribute the fluorescence signal enhancements to increased surface density and light scattering from the rough SiO2 structures. Using this information, we come up with a theoretical approximation for the enhancement factor based off the scattering effects alone. We show that increased deposition thickness of SiO2 yields improved fluorescence signal enhancements, with an optimal SiO2 thin layer achieved at 20 nm. Finally, we show that the SiO2 substrates serve as a suitable platform for disease diagnostics, and show improved limits of detection (LOD) for the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) p24 antigen.},

	abstract = {Cell membrane is made up of a complex structure of lipids and proteins that diffuse laterally giving rise to what we call membrane fluidity. During cellular development, such as differentiation cell membranes undergo dramatic fluidity changes induced by proteins such as ARC and Cofilin among others. In this study we used the generalized polarization (GP) property of fluorescent probe Laurdan using two-photon microscopy to determine membrane fluidity as a function of time and for various cell lines. A low GP value corresponds to a higher fluidity and a higher GP value is associated with a more rigid membrane. Four different cell lines were monitored such as hN2, NIH3T3, HEK293 and L6 cells. Membrane fluidity was measured at 12h, 72h and 92 h. Our results show significant changes in membrane fluidity among all cell types at different time points. GP values tend to increase significantly within 92 h in hN2 cells and 72 h in NIH3T3 cells and only at 92 h in HEK293 cells. L6 showed a marked decrease in membrane fluidity at 72 h and starts to increase at 92 h. As expected, NIH3T3 cells have more rigid membrane at earlier time points. On the other hand, neurons tend to have the highest membrane fluidity at early time points emphasizing its correlation with plasticity and the need for this malleability during differentiation. This study sheds light on the involvement of membrane fluidity during neuronal differentiation and development of other cell lines.},

Automated methods for detecting and analyzing the depolarization events (DEs) in

this study, we use 2-photon microscopy of fluorescent voltage-sensitive dyes
(VSDs) to capture the membrane voltage of actively beating human induced
pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPS-CMs). We built a custom and
freely available Matlab software, called MaDEC, to detect, quantify, and compare
DEs of hiPS-CMs treated with the β-adrenergic drugs,
propranolol and isoproterenol. The efficacy of our software is quantified by
comparing detection results against manual DE detection by expert analysts, and
comparing DE analysis results to known drug-induced electrophysiological
effects. The software accurately detected DEs with true positive rates of
98–100\% and false positive rates of 1–2\%, at
signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of 5 and above. The MaDEC software was also able
to distinguish control DEs from drug-treated DEs both immediately as well as 10

During Arabidopsis development, the intercellular movement of SHORTROOT (SHR) and subsequent interaction with its downstream target SCARECROW (SCR) control root patterning and cell fate specification. However, quantitative information about the spatio-temporal dynamics of SHR movement and SHR-SCR interaction is currently unavailable. Here, we quantify parameters including SHR mobility, oligomeric state, and association with SCR using a combination of Fluorescent Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS) techniques. We then incorporate these parameters into a mathematical model of SHR and SCR, which shows that SHR reaches a steady state in minutes, while SCR and the SHR-SCR complex reach a steady-state between 18 and 24 hr. Our model reveals the timing of SHR and SCR dynamics and allows us to understand how protein movement and protein-protein stoichiometry contribute to development., DOI:
http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14770.001, Stem cells are a specific type of cell found in both plants and animals. These cells can divide to produce daughter cells that can take on the role of any of the different tissues and organs within the plant or animal. A plant known as Arabidopsis is often used as a model in scientific research. In Arabidopsis, two proteins called SHORTROOT and SCARECROW are known to control the ability of stem cells in the roots to divide., SHORTROOT is made in cells at the center of the root known as the vasculature. From there, it moves to the next cell layer (called the endodermis) where it interacts with SCARECROW to form a protein complex. Here, Clark et al. investigated how quickly SHORTROOT moves between cells, the direction it moves in, and how it interacts with SCARECROW., The experiments used a new imaging technique called scanning fluorescence correlation spectroscopy to track the movements of SHORTROOT molecules in the root. This technique relies on the protein of interest (in this case, SHORTROOT) being attached to a fluorescent protein so that it is visible when the cells are examined. In plants that had lower levels of SCARECROW, SHORTROOT moves between cells more quickly and in an unrestricted manner. This suggests that SCARECROW forms a complex with SHORTROOT to restrict its movement in the endodermis. The experiments also show that SHORTROOT is only able to leave the endodermis to return to the vasculature when SCARECROW levels are lower than normal., Clark et al. developed a model to map the behavior of SHORTROOT and SCARECROW in the root and predict how the levels of these proteins change over time. One of the next steps following on from this work would be to test whether other proteins restrict the movement of SHORTROOT, perhaps by studying mutant plants in which SHORTROOT is less able to move., DOI:

The phasor representation of the fluorescence decay accounts for the differences in quantum yield of the free and bound form of NADH, pixel by pixel of an image. The concentration of NADH in every pixel in a cell is obtained after adding to each pixel in the phasor plot a given amount of unmodulated light which causes a shift of the phasor towards the origin by an amount that depends on the intensity at the pixel and the fluorescence lifetime at the pixel. The absolute concentration of NADH is obtained by comparison of the shift obtained at each pixel of an image with the shift of the calibrated solution.},

Monitoring the size and number of organelles in live cells is relevant for many applications but can be challenging due to their highly heterogeneous properties. Image correlation spectroscopy is a well-established analysis method capable of extracting the average size and number of particles in images. However, when image correlation spectroscopy is applied to a highly heterogeneous system, it can fail to retrieve, from a single correlation function, the characteristic size and the relative amount associated to each subspecies. Here, we describe a fast, unbiased, and fit-free algorithm based on the phasor analysis of multiple local image correlation functions, capable of mapping the sizes of elements contained in a heterogeneous system. The method correctly provides the size and number of separate subspecies, which otherwise would be hidden in the average properties of a single correlation function. We apply the method to quantify the spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the size and number of intracellular vesicles formed after endocytosis in live cells.},

This “organs-on-chips” approach aims to capture key structural and physiological characteristics of the target tissue. Here we describe in vitro vascularized microtumors (VMTs). This “tumor-on-a-chip” platform incorporates human tumor and stromal cells that grow in a 3D extracellular matrix and that depend for survival on nutrient delivery through living, perfused microvessels. Both colorectal and breast cancer cells grow vigorously in the platform and respond to standard-of-care therapies, showing reduced growth and/or regression. Vascular-targeting agents with different mechanisms of action can also be distinguished, and we find that drugs targeting only VEGFRs (Apatinib and Vandetanib) are not effective, whereas drugs that target VEGFRs, PDGFR and Tie2 (Linifanib and Cabozantinib) do regress the vasculature. Tumors in the VMT show strong metabolic heterogeneity when imaged using NADH Fluorescent Lifetime Imaging Microscopy and, compared to their surrounding stroma, many show a higher free/bound NADH ratio consistent with their known preference for aerobic glycolysis. The VMT platform provides a unique model for studying vascularized solid tumors in vitro.},

	abstract = {In a living cell, the movement of biomolecules is highly regulated by the cellular organization into subcompartments that impose barriers to diffusion, can locally break the spatial isotropy, and ultimately guide these molecules to their targets. Despite the pivotal role of these processes, experimental tools to fully probe the complex connectivity (and accessibility) of the cell interior with adequate spatiotemporal resolution are still lacking. Here, we show how the heterogeneity of molecular dynamics and the location of barriers to molecular motion can be mapped in live cells by exploiting a two-dimensional (2D) extension of the pair correlation function (pCF) analysis. Starting from a time series of images collected for the same field of view, the resulting 2D pCF is calculated in the proximity of each point for each time delay and allows us to probe the spatial distribution of the molecules that started from a given pixel. This 2D pCF yields an accurate description of the preferential diffusive routes. Furthermore, we combine this analysis with the image-derived mean-square displacement approach and gain information on the average nanoscopic molecular displacements in different directions. Through these quantities, we build a fluorescence-fluctuation-based diffusion tensor that contains information on speed and directionality of the local dynamical processes. Contrary to classical fluorescence correlation spectroscopy and related methods, this combined approach can distinguish between isotropic and anisotropic local diffusion. We argue that the measurement of this iMSD tensor will contribute to advance our understanding of the role played by the intracellular environment in the regulation of molecular diffusion at the nanoscale.},

To address this question, we investigated how polymerizing nuclear actin into persistent nuclear actin filaments affected transcription by RNA polymerase II. Nuclear filaments impaired nuclear actin dynamics by polymerizing and sequestering nuclear actin. Polymerizing actin into stable nuclear filaments disrupted the interaction of actin with RNA polymerase II and correlated with impaired RNA polymerase II localization, dynamics, gene recruitment, and reduced global transcription and cell proliferation. Polymerizing and crosslinking nuclear actin in vitro similarly disrupted the actin–RNA-polymerase-II interaction and inhibited transcription. These data rationalize the general absence of stable actin filaments in mammalian somatic nuclei. They also suggest a dynamic pool of nuclear actin is required for the proper localization and activity of RNA polymerase II., Highlighted Article: Depletion of actin in the nucleus by polymerization into stable nuclear actin filaments inhibits the actin–polymerase-II interaction, resulting in impaired RNA polymerase II activity, localization, and gene recruitment.},

	abstract = {Environmental and nutritional cues are crucial to determine genomic responses. They generally proceed through modulation of epigenetic mechanisms. Nuclear sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) is a well-known epigenetic modifier, because it deacetylates histones, and nutrient sensor, because its enzymatic activity is coupled to hydrolysis of NAD+. Compartmentalization of NAD+ metabolism makes it difficult to predict the pace of NAD+-dependent reactions in cells. Here, we use nonlinear optics in live cells to define subnuclear distribution of free and bound NADH, which determines local enzymatic activity. We define subnuclear dynamics of SIRT1 and establish a biophysical signature for SIRT1 activity in live cells. These findings have far-reaching implications, because they describe unique aspects of SIRT1 activity and delineate subnuclear territories of metabolic cues., Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) is an NAD+-dependent deacetylase that functions as metabolic sensor of cellular energy and modulates biochemical pathways in the adaptation to changes in the environment. SIRT1 substrates include histones and proteins related to enhancement of mitochondrial function as well as antioxidant protection. Fluctuations in intracellular NAD+ levels regulate SIRT1 activity, but how SIRT1 enzymatic activity impacts on NAD+ levels and its intracellular distribution remains unclear. Here, we show that SIRT1 determines the nuclear organization of protein-bound NADH. Using multiphoton microscopy in live cells, we show that free and bound NADH are compartmentalized inside of the nucleus, and its subnuclear distribution depends on SIRT1. Importantly, SIRT6, a chromatin-bound deacetylase of the same class, does not influence NADH nuclear localization. In addition, using fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy in single living cells, we reveal that NAD+ metabolism in the nucleus is linked to subnuclear dynamics of active SIRT1. These results reveal a connection between NAD+ metabolism, NADH distribution, and SIRT1 activity in the nucleus of live cells and pave the way to decipher links between nuclear organization and metabolism.},

	abstract = {All forms of progressive renal diseases develop a final pathway of tubulointerstitial fibrosis and glomerulosclerosis. Renal fibrosis is usually quantified using histological staining, a process that is time-consuming and pathologist dependent. The work described here shows the development of a fast and operator-independent method to measure fibrosis. To study renal fibrosis, the unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) model was chosen. Mice develop a time-dependent increase in obstructed kidneys; contralateral kidneys are used as controls. After UUO, kidneys were analyzed at three time points: 7 days, 14 days, and 21 days. Fibrosis was investigated using FLIM (Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging) and SHG (Second Harmonic Generation) in the deep tissue imaging microscope called DIVER (Deep Imaging via Enhanced photon Recovery). This microscope was developed for deep tissue and SHG and THG (Third Harmonic Generation) imaging and has extraordinary sensitivity towards harmonic generation. SHG data suggests the presence of more fibrillar collagen in the diseased kidneys. The combinations of short wavelength FLIM and SHG analysis results in a robust analysis procedure independent of observer interpretation and let us create a criterion to quantify the extent of fibrosis directly from the image. The progression of fibrosis in UUO model has been studied using this new FLIM-SHG technique and it shows remarkable improvement in quantification of fibrosis compared to standard histological techniques.},

The identification of bacterial metabolic states and transitions between them in their native environment promises to elucidate community behavior and stochastic processes, such as antibiotic resistance acquisition. In this work, we employ two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) to create a metabolic fingerprint of individual bacteria and populations. FLIM of autofluorescent reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate), NAD(P)H, has been previously exploited for label-free metabolic imaging of mammalian cells. However, NAD(P)H FLIM has not been established as a metabolic proxy in bacteria. Applying the phasor approach, we create FLIM-phasor maps of Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis, and Staphylococcus epidermidis at the single cell and population levels. The bacterial phasor is sensitive to environmental conditions such as antibiotic exposure and growth phase, suggesting that observed shifts in the phasor are representative of metabolic changes within the cells. The FLIM-phasor approach represents a powerful, non-invasive imaging technique to study bacterial metabolism in situ and could provide unique insights into bacterial community behavior, pathology and antibiotic resistance with sub-cellular resolution.},

Here we extended one of the Image Correlation Spectroscopy (ICS) methods, i.e. the image Mean Square Displacement, in order to study 2-dimensional diffusive and flow motion in confined systems, whose driving speed is uniformly distributed in a variable angular range. Although these conditions are not deeply investigated in the current literature, they can be commonly found in the intracellular trafficking of nanocarriers, which diffuse in the cytoplasm and/or may move along the cytoskeleton in different directions. The proposed approach could reveal the underlying system’s symmetry using methods derived from fluorescence correlation concepts and could recover dynamic and geometric features which are commonly done by single particle analyses. Furthermore, it improves the characterization of low-speed flow motions, when compared to SpatioTemporal Image Correlation Spectroscopy (STICS). Although we present a specific example (lipoplexes in living cells), the emphasis is in the discussion of the method, its basic assumptions and its validation on numeric simulations.},

We show that GNRs are not only the trapping targets, but also can enhance the optothermal trapping of other particles. This trapping phenomenon is the net result of thermophoresis and a convective flow caused by localized heating. The heating is due to the conversion of absorbed photons into heat at GNR’s longitudinal surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) wavelength. First, we investigated the optothermal trapping of GNRs at their LSPR wavelength on the glass surface with as low as 0.5 mW laser power. The trapping range was observed to be larger than a typical field of view, e.g. 210 μm × 210 μm here. Second, by adjusting the distance between the laser focus and the glass surface, ring patterns of GNRs on the glass surface were obtained. These patterns could be controlled by the laser power and the numerical aperture of the microscope objective. Moreover, we examined the spectral emission of GNRs under different trapping conditions using the spectral phasor approach to reveal the temperature and association status of GNRs. Our study will help understanding manipulation of flows in solution and in biological systems that can be applied in future investigations of GNR-induced heating and flows.},

The size of the areas containing this LLS species depends on the type of diet and the size distribution shows Western diet has much larger LLS sizes. Combination of third harmonic generation images with FLIM identified the LLS species with fat droplets and the droplet size distribution was estimated. Second harmonic generation microscopy combined with phasor FLIM shows that there is an increase in fibrosis with a Western diet. A new decomposition in three components of the phasor plot shows that a Western diet is correlated with a higher fraction of free NADH, signifying more reducing condition and more glycolytic condition. Multiparametric analysis of phasor distribution shows that from the distribution of phasor points, a Western diet fed versus a low fat diet fed samples of mice livers can be separated. The phasor approach for the analysis of FLIM images of autofluorescence in liver specimens can result in discovery of new fluorescent species and then these new fluorescent species can help assess tissue architecture. Finally integrating FLIM and second and third harmonic analysis provides a measure of the advancement of fibrosis as an effect of diet.},

Cdc42 function is best understood at the plasma membrane (PM), where it regulates cytoskeletal organization and cell polarization. Active Cdc42 has also been detected at the Golgi, but its role and regulation at this organelle are only partially understood. Here we analyze the spatial distribution of Cdc42 activity by moni­toring the dynamics of the Cdc42 FLARE biosensor using the phasor approach to FLIM-FRET. Phasor analysis revealed that Cdc42 is active at all Golgi cisternae and that this activity is controlled by Tuba and ARHGAP10, two Golgi-associated Cdc42 regulators. To our surprise, FGD1, another Cdc42 GEF at the Golgi, was not required for Cdc42 regulation at the Golgi, although its depletion decreased Cdc42 activity at the PM. Similarly, changes in Golgi morphology did not affect Cdc42 activity at the Golgi but were associated with a substantial reduction in PM-associated Cdc42 activity. Of interest, cells with reduced Cdc42 activity at the PM displayed altered centrosome morphology, suggesting that centrosome regulation may be mediated by active Cdc42 at the PM. Our study describes a novel quantitative approach to determine Cdc42 activity at specific subcellular locations and reveals new regulatory principles and functions of this small GTPase.},

Here, we used fluorescence fluctuation analyses to quantitatively explore the organization of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in the interphase nucleus of living cells. We found that this ligand-activated transcription factor diffuses within the nucleus and dynamically interacts with bodies enriched in the coregulator NCoA-2, DNA-dependent foci and chromatin targets. The distribution of the receptor among the nuclear compartments depends on NCoA-2 and the conformation of the receptor as assessed with synthetic ligands and GR mutants with impaired transcriptional abilities. Our results suggest that the partition of the receptor in different nuclear reservoirs ultimately regulates the concentration of receptor available for the interaction with specific targets, and thus has an impact on transcription regulation.},

	abstract = {Mammalian cell membranes have different phospholipid composition and cholesterol content, displaying a profile of fluidity that depends on their intracellular location. Among the dyes used in membrane studies, LAURDAN has the advantage to be sensitive to the lipid composition as well as to membrane fluidity. The LAURDAN spectrum is sensitive to the lipid composition and dipolar relaxation arising from water penetration, but disentangling lipid composition from membrane fluidity can be obtained if time resolved spectra could be measured at each cell location. Here we describe a method in which spectral and lifetime information obtained in different measurements at the same plane in a cell are used in the phasor plot providing a solution to analyze multiple lifetime or spectral data through a common visualization approach. We exploit a property of phasor plots based on the reciprocal role of the phasor plot and the image. In the phasor analysis each pixel of the image is associated with a phasor and each phasor maps to pixels and features in the image. In this paper the lifetime and spectral fluorescence data are used simultaneously to determine the contribution of polarity and dipolar relaxations of LAURDAN in each pixel of an image.},

We devised a new approach termed sideSPIM that provides uncompromised imaging performance and easy sample handling while, at the same time, offering new applications of plane illumination towards fluidics and high throughput 3D imaging of multiple specimen. Based on an inverted epifluorescence microscope, all of the previous functionality is maintained and modifications to the existing system are kept to a minimum. At the same time, our implementation is able to take full advantage of the speed of the employed sCMOS camera and piezo stage to record data at rates of up to 5 stacks/s. Additionally, sample handling is compatible with established methods and switching magnification to change the field of view from single cells to whole organisms does not require labor intensive adjustments of the system.},

Most recent studies have relied on imaging methods, which require good contrast for image resolution. Multiple sequential image processing only detects slow components of membrane dynamics. We have developed a new fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) technique, termed scanning FCS (i.e., SFCS), which performs multiple FCS measurements simultaneously by rapidly directing the excitation laser beam in a uniform (circular) scan across the bilayer of the GUVs in a repetitive fashion. The scan rate is fast compared to the diffusion of the membrane proteins and even small molecules in the GUVs. Scanning FCS outputs a “carpet” of timed fluorescence intensity fluctuations at specific points along the scan. In this study, GUVs were assembled from rat kidney brush border membranes, which included the integral membrane proteins. Scanning FCS measurements on GUVs allowed for a straightforward detection of spatial-temporal interactions between the protein and the membrane based on the diffusion rate of the protein. To test for protein incorporation into the bilayers of the GUVs, antibodies against one specific membrane protein (NaPi II cotransporter) were labeled with ALEXA-488. Fluorescence images of the GUVs in the presence of the labeled antibody showed marginal fluorescence enhancement on the GUV membrane bilayers (poor image contrast and resolution). With the application of scanning FCS, the binding of the antibody to the GUVs was detected directly from the analysis of diffusion rates of the fluorescent antibody. The diffusion coefficient of the antibody bound to NaPi II in the GUVs was ∼200-fold smaller than that in solution. Scanning FCS provided a simple, quantitative, yet highly sensitive method to study protein-membrane interactions.},

During a standard cycle of the tracking routine (32 ms), the laser beam traces four circular orbits surrounding the particle in two z planes above and below the particle. The radius of the orbits is half of the x,y-width of the point spread function, and the distance between the z planes is the z-width of the point spread function. The z-position is adjusted by moving the objective with a piezoelectric-nanopositioner. The particle position is calculated on the fly from the intensity profile obtained during the cycle, and these coordinates are used to set the scanning center for the next cycle. Applying this method, we were able to follow the motion of 500-nm diameter fluorescent polystyrene microspheres moved by a nanometric stage in either steps of 20–100 nm or sine waves of 0.1–10 μm amplitude with 20 nm precision. We also measured the diffusion coefficient of fluorospheres in glycerol solutions and recovered the values expected according to the Stokes-Einstein relationship for viscosities higher than 3.7 cP. The feasibility of this method for live cell measurements is demonstrated studying the phagocytosis of protein-coated fluorospheres by fibroblasts.},

	abstract = {Several mechanisms for cell cholesterol efflux have been proposed, including membrane microsolubilization, suggesting that the existence of specific domains could enhance the transfer of lipids to apolipoproteins. In this work isothermal titration calorimetry, circular dichroism spectroscopy, and two-photon microscopy are used to study the interaction of lipid-free apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) with small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) of 1-palmitoyl, 2-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine (POPC) and sphingomyelin (SM), with and without cholesterol. Below 30°C the calorimetric results show that apoA-I interaction with POPC/SM SUVs produces an exothermic reaction, characterized as nonclassical hydrophobic binding. The heat capacity change (ΔCp°) is small and positive, whereas it was larger and negative for pure POPC bilayers, in the absence of SM. Inclusion of cholesterol in the membranes induces changes in the observed thermodynamic pattern of binding and counteracts the formation of α-helices in the protein. Above 30°C the reactions are endothermic. Giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) of identical composition to the SUVs, and two-photon fluorescence microscopy techniques, were utilized to further characterize the interaction. Fluorescence imaging of the GUVs indicates coexistence of lipid domains under 30°C. Binding experiments and Laurdan generalized-polarization measurements suggest that there is no preferential binding of the labeled apoA-I to any particular domain. Changes in the content of α-helix, binding, and fluidity data are discussed in the framework of the thermodynamic parameters.},

	abstract = {Single-point fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) allows measurements of fast diffusion and dynamic processes in the microsecond-to-millisecond time range. For measurements on living cells, image correlation spectroscopy (ICS) and temporal ICS extend the FCS approach to diffusion times as long as seconds to minutes and simultaneously provide spatially resolved dynamic information. However, ICS is limited to very slow dynamics due to the frame acquisition rate. Here we develop novel extensions to ICS that probe spatial correlations in previously inaccessible temporal windows. We show that using standard laser confocal imaging techniques (raster-scan mode) not only can we reach the temporal scales of single-point FCS, but also have the advantages of ICS in providing spatial information. This novel method, called raster image correlation spectroscopy (RICS), rapidly measures during the scan many focal points within the cell providing the same concentration and dynamic information of FCS as well as information on the spatial correlation between points along the scanning path. Longer time dynamics are recovered from the information in successive lines and frames. We exploit the hidden time structure of the scan method in which adjacent pixels are a few microseconds apart thereby accurately measuring dynamic processes such as molecular diffusion in the microseconds-to-seconds timescale. In conjunction with simulated data, we show that a wide range of diffusion coefficients and concentrations can be measured by RICS. We used RICS to determine for the first time spatially resolved diffusions of paxillin-EGFP stably expressed in CHOK1 cells. This new type of data analysis has a broad application in biology and it provides a powerful tool for measuring fast as well as slower dynamic processes in cellular systems using any standard laser confocal microscope.},

Here, we study the dynamics of chromatin in vivo applying a novel particle-tracking method in a two-photon microscope that provides ∼10-fold higher spatial and temporal resolutions than previous measurements. We followed the motion of a chromatin sequence containing a lac-operator repeat in cells stably expressing lac repressor fused with enhanced green fluorescent protein, observing long periods of apparent constrained diffusion interrupted by relatively abrupt jumps of ∼150 nm lasting 0.3–2 s. During these jumps, the particle moved an average of four times faster than in the periods between jumps and in paths more rectilinear than predicted for random diffusion motion. Additionally, the jumps were sensitive to the temperature and absent after ATP depletion. These experimental results point to an energy-dependent mechanism driving fast motion of chromatin in interphase cells.},

	abstract = {Xenopus melanophores have pigment organelles or melanosomes which, in response to hormones, disperse in the cytoplasm or aggregate in the perinuclear region. Melanosomes are transported by microtubule motors, kinesin-2 and cytoplasmic dynein, and an actin motor, myosin-V. We explored the regulation of melanosome transport along microtubules in vivo by using a new fast-tracking routine, which determines the melanosome position every 10 ms with 2-nm precision. The velocity distribution of melanosomes transported by cytoplasmic dynein or kinesin-2 under conditions of aggregation and dispersion presented several peaks and could not be fit with a single Gaussian function. We postulated that the melanosome velocity depends linearly on the number of active motors. According to this model, one to three dynein molecules transport each melanosome in the minus-end direction. The transport in the plus-end direction is mainly driven by one to two copies of kinesin-2. The number of dyneins transporting a melanosome increases during aggregation, whereas the number of active kinesin-2 stays the same during aggregation and dispersion. Thus, the number of active dynein molecules regulates the net direction of melanosome transport. The model also shows that multiple motors of the same polarity cooperate during the melanosome transport, whereas motors of opposite polarity do not compete.},

Under these conditions, thermally induced processes are largely suppressed, and the bending rigidity and line tension are influenced by pressure-induced changes in lipid molecular packing and shape only. We studied the effect of pressure on the lateral organization and morphology of the model raft system DOPC (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine)/sphingomyelin/cholesterol as well as of the fluid mixture POPC (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine)/DLPC (1,2-dilauroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) by two-photon excitation fluorescence microscopy. The pressure-dependent experiments were carried out using a sample cell made from a thin fused silica capillary. The use of Laurdan as fluorescence label allowed us to also follow the lipid phase state by calculating the generalized polarization (GP) values of the vesicles and extracting their average value. During the compression cycle, a reduction in the volume of the vesicles is observed, accompanied by an increase of the average GP value, indicating an increasingly tighter packing of the lipids. Interestingly, the two systems studied show phenomena of budding and fission, and these at surprisingly low pressures of 200–300 bar. Moreover, these budding processes are not directly related to phase transitions to an overall ordered conformational state of the lipid membrane, which occur at much higher pressures. The topological changes of the lipid vesicles are irreversible and exhibit a different behavior depending on whether the pressure is increased or decreased. The results are discussed in light of the various contributions to the free energy functional of lipid vesicles. Finally, the biological relevance of these studies is highlighted.},

Using a functionally active fluorescent protein–uPAR in live cells, we analyzed the effect that extracellular matrix proteins and uPAR ligands have on uPAR dynamics and dimerization at the cell membrane. Vitronectin directs the recruitment of dimers and slows down the diffusion of the receptors at the basal membrane. The commitment to uPA–plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1–mediated endocytosis and recycling modifies uPAR diffusion and induces an exchange between uPAR monomers and dimers. This exchange is fully reversible. The data demonstrate that cell surface protein assemblies are important in regulating the dynamics and localization of uPAR at the cell membrane and the exchange of monomers and dimers. These results also provide a strong rationale for dynamic studies of GPI-anchored molecules in live cells at steady state and in the absence of cross-linker/clustering agents.},

The data acquired at temperatures immediately above the transition temperature of the two lipids suggest fluctuations in the lipid organization with a lifetime {\textless}0.1 s and a characteristic length of 1.2 μm. As the temperature is decreased below the transition temperature of one of the lipids, coupling between the two leaflets of the bilayer is observed to begin within the first five minutes after the onset of phase separation. However, domains confined to only one leaflet can be found during the first 45–50 min after the onset of phase separation. Our analysis using a two-state model (liquid and gel) indicates that for the first 45–50 min from the onset of phase separation the two lipid phases do not strongly influence the phase behavior of each other on the micron-length scale. At longer times, behavior that deviates from the two-state model is observed and appears to be correlated to domain morphology.},

The average brightness of the particle is obtained from the ratio of the variance to the average intensity at each pixel. To obtain the average number of fluctuating particles, we divide the average intensity at one pixel by the brightness. This analysis can be used in a wide range of concentrations. In cells, the intensity at any given pixel may be due to bright immobile structures, dim fast diffusing particles, and to autofluorescence or scattering. The total variance is given by the variance of each of the above components in addition to the variance due to detector noise. Assuming that all sources of variance are independent, the total variance is the sum of the variances of the individual components. The variance due to the particles fluctuating in the observation volume is proportional to the square of the particle brightness while the variance of the immobile fraction, the autofluorescence, scattering, and that of the detector is proportional to the intensity of these components. Only the fluctuations that depend on the square of the brightness (the mobile particles) will have a ratio of the variance to the intensity {\textgreater}1. Furthermore, changing the fluorescence intensity by increasing the illumination power, distinguishes between these possible contributions. We show maps of molecular brightness and number of cell migration proteins obtained using a two-photon scanning microscope operating with a photon-counting detector. These brightness maps reveal binding dynamics at the focal adhesions with pixel resolution and provide a picture of the binding and unbinding process in which dim molecules attach to the adhesions or large molecular aggregates dissociate from adhesion.},

Controlling polymerization pH to manipulate collagen gel microstructure, we quantified pore and fiber dimensions using both standard methods and image correlation spectroscopy (ICS) on MPM, scanning electron, and darkfield microscopy images. The latter two techniques are used to confirm microstructural measurements made from MPM images. As polymerization pH increased from 5.5 to 8.5, mean fiber diameter decreased from 3.7 ± 0.7 μm to 1.6 ± 0.3 μm, the average pore size decreased from 81.7 ± 3.7 μm2 to 7.8 ± 0.4 μm2, and the pore area fraction decreased from 56.8\% ± 0.8\% to 18.0\% ± 1.3\% (measured from SHG images), whereas the storage modulus G′ and loss modulus G″, components of the shear modulus, increased ∼33-fold and ∼16-fold, respectively. A characteristic length scale measured using ICS, WICS, correlates well with the mean fiber diameter from SHG images (R2 = 0.95). Semiflexible network theory predicts a scaling relationship of the collagen gel storage modulus (G′) depending upon mesh size and fiber diameter, which are estimated from SHG images using ICS. We conclude that MPM and ICS are an effective combination to assess bulk mechanical properties of collagen hydrogels in a noninvasive, objective, and systematic fashion and may be useful for specific in vivo applications.},

	abstract = {Paxillin is an adaptor molecule involved in the assembly of focal adhesions. Using different fluorescence fluctuation approaches, we established that paxillin-EGFP is dynamic on many timescales within the cell, ranging from milliseconds to seconds. In the cytoplasmic regions, far from adhesions, paxillin is uniformly distributed and freely diffusing as a monomer, as determined by single-point fluctuation correlation spectroscopy and photon-counting histogram analysis. Near adhesions, paxillin dynamics are reduced drastically, presumably due to binding to protein partners within the adhesions. The photon-counting histogram analysis of the fluctuation amplitudes reveals that this binding equilibrium in new or assembling adhesions is due to paxillin monomers binding to quasi-immobile structures, whereas in disassembling adhesions or regions of adhesions, the equilibrium is due to exchange of large aggregates. Scanning fluctuation correlation spectroscopy and raster-scan image correlation spectroscopy analysis of laser confocal images show that the environments within adhesions are heterogeneous. Relatively large adhesions appear to slide transversally due to a treadmilling mechanism through the addition of monomeric paxillin at one side and removal of relatively large aggregates of proteins from the retracting edge. Total internal reflection microscopy performed with a fast acquisition EM-CCD camera completes the overall dynamic picture and adds details of the heterogeneous dynamics across single adhesions and simultaneous bursts of activity at many adhesions across the cell.},

	abstract = {Study Objectives:
Recurrent apneas and hypoxemia during sleep in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) are associated with profound changes in cerebral blood flow to the extent that cerebral autoregulation may be insufficient to protect the brain. Since the brain is sensitive to hypoxia, the cerebrovascular morbidity seen in OSA could be due to chronic, cumulative effects of intermittent hypoxia. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has the potential to noninvasively monitor brain tissue oxygen saturation (SO2), and changes in concentration of oxyhemoglobin [O2Hb], deoxyhemoglobin [HHb] and total hemoglobin [tHb] with real-time resolution. We hypothesized that brain tissue oxygenation would be worse during sleep in OSA relative to controls and sought to determine the practical use of NIRS in the sleep laboratory.

Design:
We evaluated changes in brain tissue oxygenation using NIRS during overnight polysomnography.

Setting:
Studies were conducted at University of Illinois, Chicago and Carle Hospital, Urbana, Illinois.

Patients:
Nineteen subjects with OSA and 14 healthy controls underwent continuous NIRS monitoring during polysomnography.

Measurements and Results:
We observed significantly lower indexes of brain tissue oxygenation (SO2: 57.1 ± 4.9 vs. 61.5 ± 6.1), [O2Hb]: 22.8 ± 7.7 vs. 31.5 ± 9.1, and [tHb]: 38.6 ± 11.2 vs. 48.6 ±11.4 μmol/L) in OSA than controls (all P {\textless}0.05). However, multivariate analysis showed that the differences might be due to age disparity between the two groups.

Conclusions:
NIRS is an effective tool to evaluate brain tissue oxygenation in OSA. It provides valuable data in OSA assessment and has the potential to bridge current knowledge gap in OSA.

However, the precise temporal and spatial regulation of CaMKII activity in living cells has not been well described, due to lack of a specific method. Here, based on our previous work, we attempted to generate an optical probe for fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) of CaMKII activity by fusing the protein with donor and acceptor fluorescent proteins at its amino- and carboxyl-termini. We first optimized the combinations of fluorescent proteins by taking advantage of expansion of fluorescent proteins towards longer wavelength in fluorospectrometric assay. Then using digital frequency domain FLIM (DFD-FLIM), we demonstrated that the resultant protein can indeed detect CaMKII activation in living cells. These FLIM versions of Camui could be useful for elucidating the function of CaMKII both in vitro and in vivo.},

Using advanced analytical fluorescence techniques, we have characterized the diffusion properties at the single-molecule level, nanoscale organization, and specific intradomain molecular interactions of EAPs in living primary endothelial cells. This study provides compelling evidence for the existence of EAPs as physical entities at the plasma membrane, distinct from lipid rafts. Scanning electron microscopy of immunogold-labeled samples treated with a specific tetraspanin-blocking peptide identify nanoclustering of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 within EAPs as a novel mechanism for supramolecular organization that regulates the leukocyte integrin–binding capacity of both endothelial receptors during extravasation.},

The high sensitivity and highly parallel detection of EMCCD cameras allow for imaging of dynamic particle brightness, providing the capability to follow aggregation reactions in real time. A critical factor of the EMCCD camera is the presence of nonlinearity at high intensities. These nonlinearities arise due to limited capacity of the CCD well and to the analog-to-digital converter maximum range. However, we show that the specific camera we used (with a 16-bit analog-to-digital converter) has sufficient dynamic range for most microscopy applications. In addition, we explore the importance of camera timing behavior as it is affected by the vertical frame transfer speed of the camera. Although the camera has microsecond exposure time for illumination of a few pixels, the exposure time increased to milliseconds for full-field illumination. Finally, we demonstrate the ability of the technique to follow concentration changes and measure single-molecule brightness in real time in living cells.},

CaM and its target proteins form an integrated signaling network believed to be tuned spatially and temporally to control CaM's ability to appropriately pass signaling events downstream. Here, we report the spatial diffusivity and availability of CaM labeled with enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP)-CaM, at basal and elevated Ca2+, quantified by the novel fluorescent techniques of raster image scanning spectroscopy and number and brightness analysis. Our results show that in basal Ca2+ conditions cytoplasmic eGFP-CaM diffuses at a rate of 10 μm2/s, twofold slower than the noninteracting tracer, eGFP, indicating that a significant fraction of CaM is diffusing bound to other partners. The diffusion rate of eGFP-CaM is reduced to 7 μm2/s when a large (646 kDa) target protein Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase II is coexpressed in the cells. In addition, the presence of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, which can bind up to 12 CaM molecules per holoenzyme, increases the stoichiometry of binding to an average of 3 CaMs per diffusive molecule. Elevating intracellular Ca2+ did not have a major impact on the diffusion of CaM complexes. These results present us with a model whereby CaM is spatially modulated by target proteins and support the hypothesis that CaM availability is a limiting factor in the network of CaM-signaling enzymes.},

We apply the cross-variance method to determine the stoichiometry of complexes containing paxillin and vinculin or focal adhesion kinase (FAK) in disassembling adhesions in mouse embryo fibroblasts expressing FAK, vinculin, and paxillin-tagged with EGFP and mCherry. We found no complexes of these proteins in the cytoplasm away from the adhesions. However, at the adhesions, large aggregates leave, forming a hole, during their disassembly. This hole shows cross-correlation between FAK and paxillin and vinculin and paxillin. From the amplitude of the correlated fluctuations we determine the composition of the aggregates leaving the adhesions. These aggregates disassemble rapidly in the cytoplasm because large complexes are found only in very close proximity to the adhesions or at their borders.},

	abstract = {Our view of the structure and function of the interphase nucleus has drastically changed in the last years. It is now widely accepted that the nucleus is a well organized and highly compartmentalized organelle and that this organization is intimately related to nuclear function. In this context, chromatin -initially considered a randomly entangled polymer- has also been shown to be structurally organized in interphase and its organization was found to be very important to gene regulation. Relevant and not completely answered questions are how chromatin organization is achieved and what mechanisms are responsible for changes in the positions of chromatin loci in the nucleus. A significant advance in the field resulted from tagging chromosome sites with bacterial operator sequences, and visualizing these tags using green fluorescent protein fused with the appropriate repressor protein. Simultaneously, fluorescence imaging techniques significantly evolved during the last years allowing the observation of the time evolution of processes in living specimens. In this context, the motion of the tagged locus was observed and analyzed to extract quantitative information regarding its dynamics. This review focuses on recent advances in our understanding of chromatin dynamics in interphase with the emphasis placed on the information obtained from single particle tracking (SPT) experiments. We introduce the basis of SPT methods and trajectories analysis, and summarize what has been learnt by using this new technology in the context of chromatin dynamics. Finally, we briefly describe a method of SPT in a two-photon excitation microscope that has several advantages over methods based on conventional microscopy and review the information obtained by using this novel approach to study chromatin dynamics.},

NIR-STICS employs near-infrared spectroscopy to probe inside blood vessel walls and spatio-temporal image correlation spectroscopy to directly—without the use of a model—extract fluid velocity from the fluctuations within an image. Here we present computer simulations and experiments on a phantom system that demonstrate the effectiveness of NIR-STICS.},

The technique intrinsically circumvents ensemble averaging and may therefore reveal directly mechanistic details of the involved dynamic processes.

We distinguish between conventional a posteriori tracking of objects (e.g. from the sequences of images) and the experimentally more refined ‘on-the-fly’ tracking technique. In this technique, the observation volume of the microscope is kept centred with respect to the moving object via a feedback algorithm. This approach brings a series of advantages in comparison with the tracking from images, ranging from a superior spatio-temporal resolution (2–50 nm and 1–32 ms) to the capability of inferring additional data (e.g. fluorescence lifetime, emission spectrum, polarization, intensity dynamics) from an object as it moves over several microns in three dimensions. In this contribution, we describe the principle of the tracking technique as implemented on a two-photon laser scanning microscope and illustrate its capabilities with experimental data, from particles labelled with different dyes moving in a liquid to the characterization of small fluorescently labelled protein assemblies in living cells.},

However, current approaches to measure molecular transport in cells and tissues based on perturbation methods such as fluorescence recovery after photobleaching are invasive, fluctuation correlation methods are local, and single-particle tracking requires the observation of isolated particles for relatively long periods of time. We propose to detect molecular transport by measuring the time cross-correlation of fluctuations at a pair of locations in the sample. When the points are farther apart than two times the size of the point spread function, the maximum of the correlation is proportional to the average time a molecule takes to move from a specific location to another. We demonstrate the method by simulations, using beads in solution, and by measuring the diffusion of molecules in cellular membranes. The spatial pair cross-correlation method detects barriers to diffusion and heterogeneity of diffusion because the time of the correlation maximum is delayed in the presence of diffusion barriers. This noninvasive, sensitive technique follows the same molecule over a large area, thereby producing a map of molecular flow. It does not require isolated molecules, and thus many molecules can be labeled at the same time and within the point spread function.},

Using giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) as a simple model of the cell membrane, we investigated the interaction between profilin and PI(4,5)P2. A number and brightness analysis demonstrated that in the absence of profilin, molar ratios of PI(4,5)P2 above 4\% result in lipid demixing and cluster formations. Furthermore, adding profilin to GUVs made with 1\% PI(4,5)P2 leads to the formation of clusters of both profilin and PI(4,5)P2. However, due to the self-quenching of the dipyrrometheneboron difluoride-labeled PI(4,5)P2, we were unable to determine the size of these clusters.

The correlation of intensity fluctuations measured simultaneously in two channels detects protein complexes that carry two molecules of different colors. This information is obtained from the entire image. A map of the spatial distribution of protein complexes in the cell and their diffusion and/or binding properties can be constructed. Using this cross correlation raster image spectroscopy method, specific locations in the cell can be visualized where dynamics of binding and unbinding of fluorescent protein complexes occur.

	abstract = {The oligomerization of GPI-anchored proteins is thought to regulate their association with membrane microdomains, sub-cellular sorting and activity. However, these mechanisms need to be comprehensively explored in living, unperturbed cells, without artificial clustering agents, and using fluorescent protein-tagged chimeras that are fully biologically active., We expressed in HEK293 cells a biologically active chimera of the urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR), the uPAR-mEGFP-GPI. We also produced HEK293/D2D3-mEGFP-GPI cells expressing the truncated form of the receptor, lacking biological activity. We studied the dynamics and oligomerization of the two proteins, combining FCS and PCH analyses, and using subclones with homogenously low expression levels. Overall, the mobile fractions of the two proteins, constituted by monomers and dimers, had comparable diffusion coefficients. However, only for the active receptor the diffusion coefficient decreased in monomer-enriched fractions, suggesting that uPAR monomers might be preferentially engaged in multi-protein transmembrane signaling complexes., Our approach helps in limiting the alteration of the data due to out-of-focus, and minimizing the overestimation of the molecular brightness. Joint to a careful design of the cellular model, it gives reliable estimates of diffusion coefficients and oligomerization of GPI-anchored proteins, in steady state conditions, at low expression levels, and in live, unperturbed cells.},

	abstract = {The heterogeneity in composition and interaction within the cellular membrane translates into a wide range of diffusion coefficients of its constituents. Therefore, several complementary microfluorimetric techniques such as fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and single particle tracking (SPT) have to be applied to explore the dynamics of membrane components. The recently introduced raster image correlation spectroscopy (RICS) offers a much wider dynamic range than each of these methods separately and allows for spatial mapping of the dynamic properties. RICS is implemented on a confocal laser-scanning microscope (CLSM) and the wide dynamic range is achieved by exploiting the inherent time information carried by the scanning laser beam in the generation of the confocal images. The original introduction of RICS used two-photon excitation and photon counting detection. However, most CLSM systems are based on one-photon excitation with analog detection. Here we report on the performance of such a commercial CLSM (Zeiss LSM 510 META) in the study of the diffusion of the fluorescent lipid analog DiI-C18(5) (1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethyl-indodicarbocyanine perchlorate) both in giant unilamellar vesicles and in the plasma membrane of living oligodendrocytes, i.e. the myelin-producing cells of the central nervous system. It is shown that RICS on a commercial CLSM with analog detection allows for reliable results in the study of membrane diffusion by removal of unwanted correlations introduced by the analog detection system. The results obtained compare well with those collected by FRAP and FCS..},

These biomarkers are characterized by specific NIR absorption bands. The double-differential method removes patient specific variations in molecular composition which are not related to cancer, and reveals these specific cancer biomarkers. Based on the spectral regions of absorption, we identify these biomarkers with lipids that are present in tumors either in different abundance than in the normal breast or new lipid components that are generated by tumor metabolism. Furthermore, the O-H overtone regions (980–1000 nm) show distinct variations in the tumor as compared to the normal breast. To quantify spectral variation in the absorption bands, we constructed the Specific Tumor Component (STC) index. In a pilot study of 12 cancer patients we found 100\% sensitivity and 100\% specificity for lesion identification. The STC index, combined with other previously described tissue optical indices, further improves the diagnostic power of NIR for breast cancer detection.},

We quantified relative behavior such as velocities and swelling of cells as a function of cell layer during healing. We propose that increased cell volume (∼37\% at the basal layer) is the driving impetus for the start of cell migration after injury where the enlarged cells produce a point of dislocation that foreshadows and dictates the initial direction of the migrating cells. Globally, the cells follow a concerted vortex motion that is maintained after wound closure. Our results suggest that cell volume changes the migration of the cells after injury.},

EPR revealed that the N-terminal α-helix penetrates the phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate-containing membrane at a unique oblique angle and concomitantly interacts closely with helices from neighboring molecules in an antiparallel orientation. The quantitative fluorescence microscopy showed that the formation of highly ordered ENTH domain complexes beyond a critical size is essential for its vesicle tubulation activity. The mutations that interfere with the formation of large ENTH domain complexes abrogated the vesicle tubulation activity. Furthermore, the same mutations in the intact epsin 1 abolished its endocytic activity in mammalian cells. Collectively, these results show that the ENTH domain facilitates the cellular membrane budding and fission by a novel mechanism that is distinct from that proposed for BAR domains.},

For moderate count rates, this system can track particles with 15 nm spatial resolution in the lateral dimensions and 50 nm in the axial dimension at a temporal resolution of 32 ms. To investigate the interaction of the tracked particles with cellular components, we have combined our orbital tracking microscope with a dual-color, wide-field setup. Dual-color fluorescence wide-field images are recorded simultaneously in the same image plane as the particle being tracked. The functionality of the system was demonstrated by tracking fluorescent-labeled artificial viruses in tubulin-eGFP expressing HUH7 cells. The resulting trajectories can be used to investigate the microtubule network with super resolution.},

	abstract = {Background
Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) mediate bidirectional transport of proteins, RNAs, and ribonucleoproteins across the double-membrane nuclear envelope. Although there are many studies that look at the traffic in the nucleus and through the nuclear envelope we propose a method to detect the nucleocytoplasmic transport kinetics in an unperturbed cell, with no requirement for specific labeling of isolated molecules and, most important, in the presence of the cell milieu.

Methodology
The pair correlation function method (pCF) measures the time a molecule takes to migrate from one location to another within the cell in the presence of many molecules of the same kind. The spatial and temporal correlation among two arbitrary points in the cell provides a local map of molecular transport, and also highlights the presence of barriers to diffusion with millisecond time resolution and spatial resolution limited by diffraction. We use the pair correlation method to monitor a model protein substrate undergoing transport through NPCs in living cells, a biological problem in which single particle tracking (SPT) has given results that cannot be confirmed by traditional single-point FCS measurements because of the lack of spatial resolution.

Conclusions
We show that obstacles to molecular flow can be detected and that the pCF algorithm can recognize the heterogeneity of protein intra-compartment diffusion as well as the presence of barriers to transport across NE.},

One of the main advantages of SLIC is that the concept can be applied to measurements on a range of scales through simple zooming or modifications in the instrumentation. Additionally, SLIC is relatively insensitive to instrument noise through the use of correlation analysis and is insensitive to background. SLIC can provide detailed information about the direction and pattern of flow. SLIC has potential applications ranging from microfluidics to blood flow measurements.},

We used the fluorescent probe Laurdan which is sensitive to the amount of water in the membrane to show that there is a spatial heterogeneity on the scale of few pixels (the size of the pixel is 50 nm). We calculated the pixel variance of the GP function and we found that the variance has a peak at the phase transition for 3 different samples made of pure lipids. The pixel variance has an abrupt change at the phase transition of the membrane and then it slowly decreases at higher temperature. The relatively large variance of the GP indicates that the liquid phase of the membrane is quite heterogeneous even several degrees higher than the phase transition temperature. We interpreted this result as evidence of an underlying micro scale structure of the membrane in which water is not uniformly distributed at the micron scale. Imaging of these microstructures shows that the pixels with different GP tend to concentrate in specific domains in the membrane. In the case of single lipid membrane, the statistical and fluctuation analysis of the GP data shows that even such simple lipid systems are capable of generating and maintaining stable structural and organizational heterogeneities.},

Biological bilayers are complex, dynamic platforms, and thus in vivo observations usually need to be preceded by studies on model systems that simplify and discriminate the different factors involved in lipid-protein interactions. Fluorescence microscopy studies using giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) as membrane model systems provide a unique methodology to quantify protein binding, interaction and lipid solubilization in artificial bilayers. The large size of lipid domains obtainable on GUVs, together with fluorescence microscopy techniques, provides the possibility to localize and quantify molecular interactions. FCS (Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy) can be performed using the GUV model to extract information on mobility and concentration. Two-photon Laurdan GP (Generalized Polarization) reports on local changes in membrane water content (related to membrane fluidity) due to protein binding or lipid removal from a given lipid domain.

An initial phase of monomer accumulation is followed by formation of small oligomers (5–15 proteins); as protein concentration increases, an inclusion is seeded and forms in the cytoplasm; the growing inclusion recruits most of the Httex1p and depletes the cell leaving only a low concentration of monomers.

We use monomeric EGFP as a prototypical inert molecule and measure flow in and between different nuclear environments. Our results suggest that there are two disconnect molecular flows throughout the nucleus associated with high and low DNA density regions. We show that different density regions of DNA form a networked channel that allows EGFP to diffuse freely throughout, however with restricted ability to traverse the channel. We also observe rare and sudden bursts of molecules traveling across DNA density regions with characteristic time of ≈300 ms, suggesting intrinsic localized change in chromatin structure. This is a unique in vivo demonstration of the intricate chromatin network showing channel directed diffusion of an inert molecule with high spatial and temporal resolution.},

	abstract = {Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) was developed in 1972 by Magde, Elson and Webb (). Photon counting detectors and avalanche photodiodes have become standards in FCS to the point that there is a widespread belief that these detectors are essential to perform FCS experiments, despite the fact that FCS was developed using analog detectors. Spatial and temporal intensity fluctuation correlations using analog detection on a commercial Olympus Fluoview 300 microscope has been reported by . However, each analog instrument has its own idiosyncrasies that need to be understood before using the instrument for FCS. In this work we explore the capabilities of the Nikon C1, a low cost confocal microscope, to obtain single point FCS, Raster-scan Image Correlation Spectroscopy (RICS) and Number \& Brightness data both in solution and incorporated into the membrane of Giant Unilamellar Vesicles (GUVs). We show that it is possible to obtain dynamic information about fluorescent molecules from single point FCS, RICS and Number \& Brightness using the Nikon C1. We highlighted the fact that care should be taken in selecting the acquisition parameters in order to avoid possible artifacts due to the detector noise. However, due to relatively large errors in determining the distribution of digital levels for a given microscope setting, the system is probably only adequate for determining relative brightness within the same image.},

Cross-correlation raster-scan image correlation spectroscopy revealed that wild-type paxillin and the phosphorylation-inhibiting paxillin mutant Y31F-Y118F do not interact with FAK in the cytosol but a phosphomimetic mutant of paxillin, Y31E-Y118E, does. By extending cross-correlation number and brightness analysis to the total internal reflection fluorescence modality, we were able to show that tetramers of paxillin and FAK form complexes in nascent adhesions with a 1:1 stoichiometry ratio. The phosphomimetic mutations on paxillin increase the size of the complex and the assembly rate of nascent adhesions, suggesting that the physical molecular aggregation of paxillin and FAK regulates adhesion formation. In contrast, when phosphorylation is inhibited, the interaction decreases and the adhesions tend to elongate rather than turn over. These direct in vivo data show that the phosphorylation of paxillin is specific to adhesions and leads to localized complex formation with FAK to regulate the dynamics of nascent adhesions.},

The mitotic chromatin is found to allow delayed but continuous molecular flow of EGFP in and out of a high chromatin density region, which, by pair correlation function analysis, is shown as a characteristic arc shape that appears upon entry and exit. This is in contrast to interphase chromatin, which regulates flow between different density chromatin regions by means of a mechanism which turns on and off intermittently, generating discrete bursts of EGFP. We show that the interphase bursts are maintained by metabolic energy, whereas the mitotic mechanism of regulation responsible for the arc is not sensitive to ATP depletion. These two distinct routes of molecular flow were concomitantly measured in the Caenorhabditis elegans germ line, which indicates a conservation of mechanism on a scale more widespread than cell type or organism.},

	abstract = {Purpose
The purpose of this work was to gather preliminary data in normals and dry eye subjects, using a new, non-invasive imaging platform to measure the thickness of pre-corneal tear film.

Methods
Human subjects were screened for dry eye and classified as dry or normal. Tear film thickness over the inferior paracentral cornea was measured using laser illumination and a complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) camera. A previously developed mathematical model was used to calculate the thickness of the tear film by applying the principle of spatial auto-correlation function (ACF).

Results
Mean tear film thickness values (±SD) were 3.05 μm (0.20) and 2.48 μm (0.32) on the initial visit for normals (n=18) and dry eye subjects (n=22), respectively, and were significantly different (p{\textless}0.001, 2-sample t-test). Repeatability was good between visit 1 and 2 for normals (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC]=0.935) and dry eye subjects (ICC=0.950). Tear film thickness increased above baseline for the dry eye subjects following viscous drop instillation and remained significantly elevated for up to approximately 32 min (n=20; p{\textless}0.05 until 32 min; general linear mixed model and Dunnett’s tests).

Conclusions
This technique for imaging the ocular surface appears to provide tear thickness values in agreement with other non-invasive methods. Moreover, the technique can differentiate between normal and dry eye patient types.},

One of the outstanding questions in this field is the capability of MβCD to remove Chol from lipid domains having different packing. Here, we investigated the specificity of MβCD to remove Chol from coexisting macrodomains with different lipid packing. We used giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) made of 1,2-dioleoylphosphatidylcholine:1,2-dipalmitoylphatidylcholine:free cholesterol, 1:1:1 molar ratio at 27°C. Under these conditions, individual GUVs present Chol distributed into lo and ld phases. The two phases can be distinguished and visualized using Laurdan generalized polarization and two-photon excitation fluorescence microscopy. Our data indicate that MβCD removes Chol preferentially from the more disordered phase. The process of selective Chol removal is dependent on the MβCD concentration. At high concentrations, MβCD also removes phospholipids.},

	abstract = {The sodium-dependent phosphate (Na/Pi) transporters NaPi-2a and NaPi-2c play a major role in the renal reabsorption of Pi. The functional need for several transporters accomplishing the same role is still not clear. However, the fact that these transporters show differential regulation under dietary and hormonal stimuli suggests different roles in Pi reabsorption. The pathways controlling this differential regulation are still unknown, but one of the candidates involved is the NHERF family of scaffolding PDZ proteins. We propose that differences in the molecular interaction with PDZ proteins are related with the differential adaptation of Na/Pi transporters. Pdzk1−/− mice adapted to chronic low Pi diets showed an increased expression of NaPi-2a protein in the apical membrane of proximal tubules but impaired up-regulation of NaPi-2c. These results suggest an important role for PDZK1 in the stabilization of NaPi-2c in the apical membrane. We studied the specific protein-protein interactions of Na/Pi transporters with NHERF-1 and PDZK1 by FRET. FRET measurements showed a much stronger interaction of NHERF-1 with NaPi-2a than with NaPi-2c. However, both Na/Pi transporters showed similar FRET efficiencies with PDZK1. Interestingly, in cells adapted to low Pi concentrations, there were increases in NaPi-2c/PDZK1 and NaPi-2a/NHERF-1 interactions. The differential affinity of the Na/Pi transporters for NHERF-1 and PDZK1 proteins could partially explain their differential regulation and/or stability in the apical membrane. In this regard, direct interaction between NaPi-2c and PDZK1 seems to play an important role in the physiological regulation of NaPi-2c.},

There are other techniques to measure diffusion coefficients and binding; however, RICS fills a unique niche.

Alternatively, ECM stiffness can be modulated independently from protein concentration by mechanically loading the ECM. We have developed a novel device for generating stiffness gradients in naturally derived ECMs, where stiffness is tuned by inducing strain, while local mechanical properties are directly determined by laser tweezers based active microrheology (AMR). Hydrogel substrates polymerized within 35 mm diameter Petri dishes are strained non-uniformly by the precise rotation of an embedded cylindrical post, and exhibit a position-dependent stiffness with little to no modulation of local mesh geometry. Here we present the device in the context of fibrin hydrogels. First AMR is used to directly measure local micromechanics in unstrained hydrogels of increasing fibrin concentration. Changes in stiffness are then mapped within our device, where fibrin concentration is held constant. Fluorescence confocal imaging and orbital particle tracking are used to quantify structural changes in fibrin on the micro and nano levels respectively. The micromechanical strain stiffening measured by microrheology is not accompanied by ECM microstructural changes under our applied loads, as measured by confocal microscopy. However, super-resolution orbital tracking reveals nanostructural straightening, lengthening, and reduced movement of fibrin fibers. Furthermore, we show that aortic smooth muscle cells cultured within our device are morphologically sensitive to the induced mechanical gradient. Our results demonstrate a powerful cell culture tool that can be used in the study of mechanical effects on cellular physiology in naturally derived 3D ECM tissues.},

High concentrations of the toxin cause the lysis of several cells such as erythrocytes, granulocytes, monocytes, endothelial and renal epithelial cells of different species. At low concentrations it induces the production of cytokines and apoptosis. Since many of the subcytolytic effects in other cells have been reported to be triggered by the increase of intracellular calcium, we followed the calcium concentration inside the erythrocytes while incubating with sublytic concentrations of HlyA. Calcium concentration was monitored using the calcium indicator Green 1, 2-photon excitation, and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). Data were analyzed using the phasor representation. In this report, we present evidence that, at sublytic concentrations, HlyA induces an increase of calcium concentration in rabbit erythrocytes in the first 10 s. Results are discussed in relation to the difficulties of measuring calcium concentrations in erythrocytes where hemoglobin is present, the contribution of the background and the heterogeneity of the response observed in individual cells.},

	abstract = {DC-SIGN, a Ca2+-dependent transmembrane lectin, is found assembled in microdomains on the plasma membranes of dendritic cells. These microdomains bind a large variety of pathogens and facilitate their uptake for subsequent antigen presentation. In this study, DC-SIGN dynamics in microdomains were explored with several fluorescence microscopy methods and compared with dynamics for influenza hemagglutinin (HA), which is also found in plasma membrane microdomains. Fluorescence imaging indicated that DC-SIGN microdomains may contain other C-type lectins and that the DC-SIGN cytoplasmic region is not required for microdomain formation. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching measurements showed that neither full-length nor cytoplasmically truncated DC-SIGN in microdomains appreciably exchanged with like molecules in other microdomains and the membrane surround, whereas HA in microdomains exchanged almost completely. Line-scan fluorescence correlation spectroscopy indicated an essentially undetectable lateral mobility for DC-SIGN but an appreciable mobility for HA within their respective domains. Single-particle tracking with defined-valency quantum dots confirmed that HA has significant mobility within microdomains, whereas DC-SIGN does not. By contrast, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching indicated that inner leaflet lipids are able to move through DC-SIGN microdomains. The surprising stability of DC-SIGN microdomains may reflect structural features that enhance pathogen uptake either by providing high-avidity platforms and/or by protecting against rapid microdomain endocytosis.},

In this method we use intrinsic fluorescence biomarkers and the phasor approach to fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy in conjunction with image segmentation, which we use to introduce the concept of the cell phasor. In live tissues we are able to identify intrinsic fluorophores, such as collagen, retinol, retinoic acid, porphyrin, flavins, and free and bound NADH. We have exploited the cell phasor approach to detect a trend in metabolite concentrations along the main axis of the Caenorhabditis elegans germ line. This trend is consistent with known changes in metabolic states during differentiation. The cell phasor approach to lifetime imaging provides a label-free, fit-free, and sensitive method to identify different metabolic states of cells during differentiation, to sense small changes in the redox state of cells, and may identify symmetric and asymmetric divisions and predict cell fate. Our method is a promising noninvasive optical tool for monitoring metabolic pathways during differentiation or disease progression, and for cell sorting in unlabeled tissues.},

For each condition, phase plane plots, cross correlation functions, and connectivity indices were generated for O2Hb, HHb, and tHb. The amplitude of the concentration changes in O2Hb and HHb depends on the age of the subject. We found large regions of connectivity, which were similar for resting state and task conditions. This means the spatial relationships during resting state, when changes in O2Hb, HHb, and tHb corresponded to spontaneous oscillations, were correlated to the spatial patterns during the activation tasks, when changes in O2Hb, HHb, and tHb concentration were related to the alternation of stimulation and rest. Thus, the vascular functional connectivity was also present during resting state. The findings suggest that the vascular response to functional activation may be a nonlinear synchronization phenomenon and that resting state processes are more important than previously expected.},

We find that the transport of the classical receptor karyopherin-β1 (Kapβ1) is regulated so as to produce a peculiar distribution of characteristic times at the NPC. This regulation, which is spatially restricted to the pore, depends on the properties and metabolic energy of Kapβ1. As such, this method provides a powerful tool for studying nucleocytoplasmic shuttling at the nanometer scale under physiological conditions.},

	abstract = {The kidney is a key regulator of phosphate homeostasis. There are two predominant renal sodium phosphate cotransporters, NaPi2a and NaPi2c. Both are regulated by parathyroid hormone (PTH), which decreases the abundance of the NaPi cotransporters in the apical membrane of renal proximal tubule cells. The time course of PTH-induced removal of the two cotransporters from the apical membrane, however, is markedly different for NaPi2a compared with NaPi2c. In animals and in cell culture, PTH treatment results in almost complete removal of NaPi2a from the brush border (BB) within 1 h whereas for NaPi2c this process in not complete until 4 to 8 h after PTH treatment. The reason for this is poorly understood. We have previously shown that the unconventional myosin motor myosin VI is required for PTH-induced removal of NaPi2a from the proximal tubule BB. Here we demonstrate that myosin VI is also necessary for PTH-induced removal of NaPi2c from the apical membrane. In addition, we show that, while at baseline the two cotransporters have similar diffusion coefficients within the membrane, after PTH addition the diffusion coefficient for NaPi2a initially exceeds that for NaPi2c. Thus NaPi2c appears to remain “tethered” in the apical membrane for longer periods of time after PTH treatment, accounting, at least in part, for the difference in response times to PTH of NaPi2a versus NaPi2c.},

Patient-specific tumor spatial heterogeneities are visualized through a heterogeneity spectrum function (HS). HS is a biomarker that can be attributed to different molecular distributions within the tumor. To classify lesion heterogeneities, we built a heterogeneity index (HI) derived from the HS by weighing the HS in specific NIR absorption bands. It is shown that neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) response is potentially related to the tumor heterogeneity. Therefore, we correlate the heterogeneity index obtained prior to treatment with the final response to NAC. From a pilot study of 15 cancer patients treated with NAC, pathological complete responders (pCR) were separated from non-pCR according to their HI (–44 ± 12 and 43 ± 17, p = 3 × 10−8, respectively). We conclude that the HS function is a biomarker that can be used to visualize spatial heterogeneities in lesions, and the baseline HI prior to therapy correlates with chemotherapy pathological response.},

The recent development of several advanced imaging techniques has allowed detailed analysis of how NaPi proteins interact with scaffolding proteins and myosin motors. Using techniques such as apical total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, raster image correlation spectroscopy, and fluorescence lifetime imaging-Förster resonance energy transfer, we have found that a myosin motor is involved in trafficking of the NaPi cotransporters and also that Npt2a and Npt2c seem to have different affinities for the PDZ protein Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor 1. Further application of these techniques will provide additional insights into NaPi trafficking and regulation.},

The SRDS method is based on the assumption of the exclusive presence of this spectroscopic biomaker in malignant disease. Although clinical results using this method have already been published, the dependence of the STC spectra on the choice of reference tissue has not yet been addressed. In this study, we explore the impact of the selection of the reference region size and location on the STC spectrum in 10 subjects with malignant breast tumors. Referencing from both contralateral and ipsilateral sides was performed. Regardless of the referencing, we are able to obtain consistent high contrast images of malignant lesions using the STC with less than 13\% deviation. These results suggest that the STC measurements are independent of any type, location, and amount of normal breast tissue used for referencing. This confirms the initial assumption of the SRDS analysis, that there are specific tumor components in cancer that do not exist in normal tissue. This also indicates that bilateral measurements are not required for lesion identification using the STC method.},

The Caskin1 polymer interface exhibits a remarkable segregation of charge residues, resulting in a high sensitivity to ionic strength in vitro.

We measure at the single-cell level the EGFP localization and molecular flow patterns characteristic of each stage of chromatin compaction from mitosis through interphase by means of pair-correlation analysis. We find that the naturally occurring changes in chromatin organization impart a regulation on the spatial distribution and temporal dynamics of EGFP within the nucleus.

	abstract = {Background
How morphogen gradients form has long been a subject of controversy. The strongest support for the view that morphogens do not simply spread by free diffusion has come from a variety of studies of the Decapentaplegic (Dpp) gradient of the Drosophila larval wing disc.

Results
In the present study, we initially show how the failure, in such studies, to consider the coupling of transport to receptor-mediated uptake and degradation has led to estimates of transport rates that are orders of magnitude too low, lending unwarranted support to a variety of hypothetical mechanisms, such as “planar transcytosis” and “restricted extracellular diffusion”. Using several independent dynamic methods, we obtain data that are inconsistent with such models, and that show directly that Dpp transport occurs by simple, rapid diffusion in the extracellular space. We discuss the implications of these findings for other morphogen systems in which complex transport mechanisms have been proposed.

Conclusions
We believe that these findings resolve a major, longstanding question about morphogen gradient formation, and provide a solid framework for interpreting experimental observations of morphogen gradient dynamics.},

	abstract = {Cellular membranes are heterogeneous in composition, and the prevailing theory holds that the structures responsible for this heterogeneity in vivo are small structures (10–200 nm), sterol- and sphingolipid-enriched, of different sizes, highly dynamic denominated rafts. Rafts are postulated to be platforms, which by sequestering different membrane components can compartmentalize cellular processes and regulate signaling pathways. Despite an enormous effort in this area, the existence of these domains is still under debate due to the characteristics of the structures itself: small in size and highly mobile, which from the technical point of view implies using techniques with high spatial and temporal resolution. In this report we measured rapid fluctuations of the normalized ratio of the emission intensity at two wavelengths of Laurdan, a membrane fluorescent dye sensitive to local membrane packing. We observed generalized polarization fluctuations in the plasma membrane of intact rabbit erythrocytes and Chinese hamster ovary cells that can be explained by the existence of tightly packed micro-domains moving in a more fluid background phase. These structures, which display different lipid packing, have different sizes; they are found in the same cell and in the entire cell population. The small size and characteristic high lipid packing indicate that these micro-domains have properties that have been proposed for lipid rafts.},

	abstract = {Ebola virus assembles and buds from the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane of mammalian cells, which is primarily attributed to its major matrix protein VP40. Oligomerization of VP40 has been shown to be essential to the life cycle of the virus including formation of virions from infected cells. To date, VP40 oligomerization has mainly been assessed by chemical cross-linking following cell fractionation studies with VP40 transfected cells. This has made it difficult to discern the spatial and temporal dynamics of VP40 oligomerization. To gain a better understanding of the VP40 assembly and oligomerization process in live cells, we have employed real-time imaging of enhanced green fluorescent protein tagged VP40. Here, we use both confocal and total internal reflection microscopy coupled with number and brightness analysis to show that VP40 oligomers are localized on the plasma membrane and are highly enriched at sites of membrane protrusion, consistent with sites of viral budding. These filamentous plasma membrane protrusion sites harbor VP40 hexamers, octamers, and higher order oligomers. Consistent with previous reports, abrogation of VP40 oligomerization through mutagenesis greatly diminished VP40 egress and also abolished membrane protrusion sites enriched with VP40. In sum, real-time single-molecule imaging of fluorescently labeled Ebola VP40 is able to resolve the spatial and temporal dynamics of VP40 oligomerization.},

Several noncoding LRRK2 gene polymorphisms have been associated with susceptibility to Parkinson's disease (PD), Crohn's disease, and leprosy. Many LRRK2 coding polymorphisms have been associated with or causally linked to PD. The G2019S point mutation within the LRRK2 kinase domain is the most common cause of familial PD. The G2019S mutation appears to alter LRRK2 kinase activity. Some but not all studies have reported that LRRK2 kinase activity is dependent upon LRRK2 dimerization and membrane localization. It is important to define the oligomeric state(s) of LRRK2 in living cells, which to date have only been characterized in vitro. Here we use confocal and total internal reflection microscopy coupled with number and brightness analysis to study the oligomeric states of LRRK2 within the cytosol and on the plasma membrane of live CHO-K1 cells. Our results show, for the first time to our knowledge, that LRRK2 is predominantly monomeric throughout the cytosol of living cells, but attains predominately higher oligomeric states in the plasma membrane.},

Using intrinsic cellular fluorophores, we perform fluorescence lifetime microscopy (FLIM) and phasor analysis to obtain hESC metabolic signatures. We identify two optical biomarkers to define the differentiation status of hESCs: Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and lipid droplet-associated granules (LDAGs). These granules have a unique lifetime signature and could be formed by the interaction of reactive oxygen species and unsaturated metabolic precursor that are known to be abundant in hESC. Changes in the relative concentrations of these two intrinsic biomarkers allow for the discrimination of undifferentiated hESCs from differentiating hESCs. During early hESC differentiation we show that NADH concentrations increase, while the concentration of LDAGs decrease. These results are in agreement with a decrease in oxidative phosphorylation rate. Single-cell phasor FLIM signatures reveal an increased heterogeneity in the metabolic states of differentiating H9 and H1 hESC colonies. This technique is a promising noninvasive tool to monitor hESC metabolism during differentiation, which can have applications in high throughput analysis, drug screening, functional metabolomics and induced pluripotent stem cell generation.},

How such intricate meshwork relates to function and gives rise to a transport mechanism is still unclear. Here we set out to tackle this issue in intact cells by an established combination of fluorescence correlation spectroscopy and real-time tracking of the center of mass of single NPCs. We find the dynamics of nucleoporin Nup153 to be regulated so as to produce rapid, discrete exchange between two separate positions within the NPC. A similar behavior is also observed for both karyopherinβ1 transport-receptor and cargoes destined to nuclear import. Thus, we argue that directed Nup-mediated molecular motion may represent an intrinsic feature of the overall selective gating through intact NPCs.},

We use the phasor- fluorescence lifetime image microscopy approach to spatially map NADH in both the free and bound forms of live undifferentiated and differentiated myoblast cells. The phasor approach graphically depicts the change in lifetime at a pixel level without the requirement for fitting the decay. Comparison of the spatial distribution of NADH in the nucleus of cells induced to differentiate through serum starvation and undifferentiated cells show differing distributions of bound and free NADH. Undifferentiated cells displayed a short lifetime indicative of free NADH in the nucleus and a longer lifetime attributed to the presence of bound NADH outside of the nucleus. Differentiating cells displayed redistribution of free NADH with decreased relative concentration of free NADH within the nucleus whereas the majority of NADH was found in the cytoplasm.},

The scanning pattern is adapted to the shape of the object according to a feedback principle based on intensity modulation measurements. The modulation of the intensity with respect to the angular coordinate is used to keep the orbit centered on the object. The modulation induced by rapid oscillations of the orbit radius is used to measure the local distance from the surface with nanometer precision. We provide a model to describe the fundamental relationship between modulation and distance and discuss the range of validity of several approximate expressions. According to this model the distance can be measured with a precision dependent on the steepness of the Point Spread Function and the total number of detected photons. To test our findings we performed experiments with one or two channels on fluorescent spheres of known size and characterized the modulation function of our microscope setup. We conclude that the method can be used to measure distances in the range 10–200nm between two surfaces labeled with two different probes.},

	abstract = {Near-infrared (NIR) (650 to 1000 nm) optical properties of turbid media can be quantified accurately and noninvasively using methods based on diffuse reflectance or transmittance, such as frequency-domain photon migration (FDPM). Conventional FDPM techniques based on white-light steady-state (SS) spectral measurements in conjunction with the acquisition of frequency-domain (FD) data at selected wavelengths using laser diodes are used to measure broadband NIR scattering-corrected absorption spectra of turbid media. These techniques are limited by the number of wavelength points used to obtain FD data and by the sweeping technique used to collect FD data over a relatively large range. We have developed a method that introduces several improvements in the acquisition of optical parameters, based on the digital parallel acquisition of a comb of frequencies and on the use of a white laser as a single light source for both FD and SS measurements. The source, due to the high brightness, allows a higher penetration depth with an extremely low power on the sample. The parallel acquisition decreases the time required by standard serial systems that scan through a range of modulation frequencies. Furthermore, all-digital acquisition removes analog noise, avoids the analog mixer, and does not create radiofrequency interference or emission.},

NaPi-2b is regulated by changes in dietary Pi but the mechanisms underlying this regulation are largely undetermined. Sequence analyses show NaPi-2b has a PDZ binding motif at its C terminus. Immunofluorescence imaging shows NaPi-2b and two PDZ domain containing proteins, NHERF1 and PDZK1, are expressed in the apical microvillar domain of rat small intestine enterocytes. Co-immunoprecipitation studies in rat enterocytes show that NHERF1 associates with NaPi-2b but not PDZK1. In HEK co-expression studies, GFP-NaPi-2b co-precipitates with FLAG-NHERF1. This interaction is markedly diminished when the C-terminal four amino acids are truncated from NaPi-2b. FLIM-FRET analyses using tagged proteins in CACO-2BBE cells show a distinct phasor shift between NaPi-2b and NHERF1 but not between NaPi-2b and the PDZK1 pair. This shift demonstrates that NaPi-2b and NHERF1 reside within 10 nm of each other. NHERF1−/− mice, but not PDZK1−/− mice, had a diminished adaptation of NaPi-2b expression in response to a low Pi diet. Together these studies demonstrate that NHERF1 associates with NaPi-2b in enterocytes and regulates NaPi-2b adaptation.},

We show that different metabolic states are related to different cell differentiation stages and to stem cell bias to neuronal and glial fate, prior the expression of lineage markers. Our data demonstrate that the NADH FLIM signature distinguishes non-invasively neurons from undifferentiated neural progenitor and stem cells (NPSCs) at two different developmental stages (E12 and E16). NPSCs follow a metabolic trajectory from a glycolytic phenotype to an oxidative phosphorylation phenotype through different stages of differentiation. NSPCs are characterized by high free/bound NADH ratio, while differentiated neurons are characterized by low free/bound NADH ratio. We demonstrate that the metabolic signature of NPSCs correlates with their differentiation potential, showing that neuronal progenitors and glial progenitors have a different free/bound NADH ratio. Reducing conditions in NPSCs correlates with their neurogenic potential, while oxidative conditions correlate with glial potential.

The detection scheme relies on a wide area detector, minimal optical components and an emission path bathed in a refractive-index-matching fluid that minimizes emission photon losses. This detection scheme proved to be very efficient, allowing us to obtain high resolution images at depths up to 3 mm. This technique was applied to in vivo imaging of the murine small intestine (SI) and colon. The challenge is to image normal and diseased tissue in the whole live animal, while maintaining high resolution imaging at millimeter depth. In Lgr5-GFP mice, we have been successful in imaging Lgr5-eGFP positive stem cells, present in SI and colon crypt bases.},

	abstract = {The beneficial effects of pharmacotherapy on children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are well documented. We use near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) methodology to determine reorganization of brain neurovascular properties following the medication treatment. Twenty-six children with ADHD (ages six through 12) participated in a modified laboratory school protocol to monitor treatment response with lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX; Vyvanse®, Shire US Inc.). All children refrained from taking medication for at least two weeks (washout period). To detect neurovascular reorganization, we measured changes in synchronization of oxy (HbO2) and deoxy (HHb) hemoglobin waves between the two frontal lobes. Participants without medication displayed average baseline HbO2 phase difference at about −7-deg. and HHb differences at about 240-deg.. This phase synchronization index changed after pharmacological intervention. Medication induced an average phase changes of HbO2 after first medication to 280-deg. and after medication optimization to 242-deg.. Instead first medication changed of the average HHb phase difference at 186-deg. and then after medication optimization to 120-deg. In agreement with findings of White et al., and Varela et al., we associated the phase synchronization differences of brain hemodynamics in children with ADHD with lobe specific hemodynamic reorganization of HbO2- and HHB oscillations following medication status.},

	abstract = {We present here the phasor approach to biosensor FRET detection by fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) and show that this method of data representation is robust towards biosensor design as well as the fluorescence artifacts inherent to the cellular environment. We demonstrate this property on a series of dual and single chain biosensors which report the localization of Rac1 and RhoA activity, whilst performing concomitant ratiometric FRET analysis on the acquired FLIM data by the generalized polarization (GP) approach. We then evaluate and compare the ability of these two methods to quantitatively image biosensor FRET signal as a function of time and space. We find that with lifetime analysis in the phasor plot each molecular species is transformed into a two dimensional coordinate system where independent mixtures of fluorophores can be distinguished from changes in lifetime due to FRET. This enables the fractional contribution of the free and bound state of a dual chain biosensor or the low and high FRET species of a single chain biosensor to be quantified in each pixel of an image. The physical properties intrinsic to each biosensor design are also accurately characterized by the phasor analysis; thus this method could be used to inform biosensor optimization at the developmental stage. We believe that as biosensors become more sophisticated and are multiplexed with other fluorescent molecular tools, biosensor FRET detection by the phasor approach to FLIM will not only become imperative to their use but also their advancement.},

We discuss here the detection of molecular transport by exploiting spatiotemporal correlations measured among points at large distances ({\textgreater}1 μm). We illustrate the evolution of the conceptual framework that started with single-point fluorescence fluctuation analysis based on the transit of fluorescent molecules through a small volume of illumination. This idea has evolved to include the measurement of fluctuations at many locations in the sample using microscopy imaging methods. Image fluctuation analysis has become a rich and powerful technique that can be used to extract information about the spatial distribution of molecular concentration and transport in cells and tissues.},

	abstract = {Changes in the amounts of cellular eumelanin and pheomelanin have been associated with carcinogenesis. The goal of this work is to develop methods based on two-photon-excited-fluorescence (TPEF) for measuring relative concentrations of these compounds. We acquire TPEF emission spectra (λex=1000  nm) of melanin in vitro from melanoma cells, hair specimens, and in vivo from healthy volunteers. We find that the pheomelanin emission peaks at approximately 615 to 625 nm and eumelanin exhibits a broad maximum at 640 to 680 nm. Based on these data we define an optical melanin index (OMI) as the ratio of fluorescence intensities at 645 and 615 nm. The measured OMI for the MNT-1 melanoma cell line is 1.6±0.22 while the Mc1R gene knockdown lines MNT-46 and MNT-62 show substantially greater pheomelanin production (OMI=0.5±0.05 and 0.17±0.03, respectively). The measured values are in good agreement with chemistry-based melanin extraction methods. In order to better separate melanin fluorescence from other intrinsic fluorophores, we perform fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy of in vitro specimens. The relative concentrations of keratin, eumelanin, and pheomelanin components are resolved using a phasor approach for analyzing lifetime data. Our results suggest that a noninvasive TPEF index based on spectra and lifetime could potentially be used for rapid melanin ratio characterization both in vitro and in vivo.},

Considering the importance collecting data in live sample increases the technical challenges required to solve these issues., This work presents a practical version of a microscopy method, Selective Plane Illumination Microscopy reintroduced by . This method is gaining importance in the biomedical field, with its load of technical solutions but has been limited by difficulties associated with unconventional microscope construction using two objectives and sample preparation. Based on the selective plane illumination principle but with a design similar to the Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence microscope,  demonstrated the Oblique Plane Microscope (OPM) using a single objective which uses conventional sample preparation protocols. However, the Dunsby instrument was not intended to be part of a commercial microscope., In this work we describe a system with the advantages of OPM and that can be used as an add-on to commonly used microscopes, such as IX-71 Olympus, simplifying the construction of the OPM and increasing performance of a conventional microscope.

However, most studies to date have failed to characterize these interactions on a length scale relevant to cells, especially in three-dimensional (3D) matrices. Here we utilized two complementary methods, spatio-temporal image correlation spectroscopy (STICS) and laser optical tweezers-based active microrheology (AMR), to quantify endothelial cell (EC)-mediated deformations of individual ECM elements and the local ECM mechanical properties, respectively, during the process of capillary morphogenesis in a 3D cell culture model. In experiments in which the ECM density was systematically varied, STICS revealed that the rate at which ECs deformed individual ECM fibers on the microscale positively correlated with capillary sprouting on the macroscale. ECs expressing constitutively active V14-RhoA displaced individual matrix fibers at significantly faster rates and displayed enhanced capillary sprouting relative to wild-type cells, while those expressing dominant-negative N19-RhoA behaved in an opposite fashion. In parallel, AMR revealed a local stiffening of the ECM proximal to the tips of sprouting ECs. By quantifying the dynamic physical properties of the cell-ECM interface in both space and time, we identified a correlation linking ECM deformation rates and local ECM stiffening at the microscale with capillary morphogenesis at the macroscale.},

Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi are root symbionts that might improve the ability of plants to compete for organic nitrogen products against other decomposer microbes.

We developed a novel quantitative nanotechnological technique to determine in situ that organic nitrogen uptake by AM fungi can occur to a greater extent than has previously been assumed. Specifically, we found that AM fungi acquired recalcitrant and labile forms of organic nitrogen. Moreover, N enrichment of soil reduced plot-scale uptake of these compounds. Since most plants host AM fungi, AM use of organic nitrogen could widely influence plant productivity, especially where N availability is relatively low.},

The MSD analysis was supported by the calculation of the three-dimensional asphericity, A3, which was close to unity, denoting the preponderant occurrence of movement along a direction. To elucidate the role of the cytoskeleton structure in the lipoplex trafficking, cells were treated with cytoskeleton (actin microfilaments and microtubules) polymerization inhibitors (latrunculin B and nocodazole, respectively). When cells were treated with inhibitors, the lipoplex movement tended towards a random walk at the expense of directed motion. The disassembly of microtubules had a stronger effect on the reduction of directional movement than that of actin microfilaments. Relevance of the results for enhanced gene delivery is discussed.},

However, those probes usually suffer from underisable photophysical/photochemical processes, such us blinking and photobleaching, limiting their utilization. The main challenges in fluorescent probe design are to improve their absorption/emission properties, and to provide higher stability against photobleaching. In the last few years, metallic nanoparticles (NPs) of various sizes, shapes, and compositions have been used as a new alternative for cellular microscopy. This is in part because –unlike common organic dyes and Qdots– metallic NPs do not bleach or blink upon continuous illumination, are extremely stable, very bright, and their luminescence spans over the visible spectrum. These characteristics make them an attractive contrast agent for cell imaging both in vitro and in vivo. For these reasons, the emission of metallic NPs in bulk solutions has already been extensively characterized. In contrast with bulk experiments, where billions of molecules are measured simultaneously, single particle techniques allow the observation of characteristics and dynamical processes otherwise hidden in the measured average. A full understanding of the photophysical properties of the NPs is critical when they are used for single-molecule applications. Photophysical processes can be a source of artifacts if they are not interpreted accordingly and thus a careful characterization of these labels at the single particle level became crucial for the correct interpretation of the experimental results. In this work we study some of their unique optical properties at the single particle level, and show examples that illustrate their intrinsic heterogeneity when used in biological environments.},

	abstract = {The movement of macromolecules in cells is assumed to occur either through active transport or by diffusion. However the determination of the diffusion coefficients in cells using fluctuation methods or FRAP frequently give diffusion coefficient that are orders of magnitude smaller than the diffusion coefficients measured for the same macromolecule in solution. It is assumed that the cell internal viscosity is partially responsible for this decrease in the apparent diffusion. When the apparent diffusion is too slow to be due to cytoplasm viscosity, it is assumed that weak binding of the macromolecules to immobile or quasi immobile structures is taking place. In this paper we derive equations for fitting of the RICS (Raster-scan Image Correlations Spectroscopy) data in cells to a model that includes transient binding to immobile structures and we show that under some conditions, the spatio-temporal correlation provided by the RICS approach can distinguish the process of diffusion and weak binding. We apply the method to determine the diffusion in the cytoplasm and binding of Focal Adhesion Kinase-EGFP to adhesions in MEF cells.},

	abstract = {Calcium controls an array of key events in keratinocytes and epidermis: localized changes in Ca2+ concentrations and their regulation are therefore especially important to assess when observing epidermal barrier homeostasis and repair, neonatal barrier establishment, in differentiation, signaling, cell adhesion, and in various pathological states. Yet, tissue- and cellular Ca2+ concentrations in physiologic and diseased states are only partially known, and difficult to measure. Prior observations on the Ca2+ distribution in skin were based on Ca2+ precipitation followed by electron microscopy, or proton-induced X-ray emission. Neither cellular and/or subcellular localization could be determined through these approaches. In cells in vitro, fluorescent dyes have been used extensively for ratiometric measurements of static and dynamic Ca2+ concentrations, also assessing organelle Ca2+ concentrations. For lack of better methods, these findings together build the basis for the current view of the role of Ca2+ in epidermis, their limitations notwithstanding. Here we report a method using Calcium Green 5N as the calcium sensor and the phasor-plot approach to separate raw lifetime components. Thus, fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) enables us to quantitatively assess and visualize dynamic changes of Ca2+ at light-microscopic resolution in ex vivo biopsies of unfixed epidermis, in close to in vivo conditions. Comparing undisturbed epidermis with epidermis following a barrier insult revealed major shifts, and more importantly, a mobilization of high amounts of Ca2+ shortly following barrier disruption, from intracellular stores. These results partially contradict the conventional view, where barrier insults abrogate a Ca2+ gradient towards the stratum granulosum. Ca2+ FLIM overcomes prior limitations in the observation of epidermal Ca2+ dynamics, and will allow further insights into basic epidermal physiology.},

Several HHRs such as somatostatin receptors (SSTRs), however, form homo- and heterooligomers when activated by ligand binding. By using dual fluorescent ligands simultaneously applied to live cells monotransfected with SSTR5 (R5) or SSTR1 (R1), or cotransfected with R5 and R1, we have analyzed the ligand receptor stoichiometry and aggregation states for the three receptor systems by fluorescence resonance energy transfer and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. Both homo- and heterooligomeric receptors are occupied by two ligand molecules. We find that monomeric, homooligomeric, and heterooligomeric receptor species occur in the same cell cotransfected with two SSTRs, and that oligomerization of SSTRs is regulated by ligand binding by a selective process that is restricted to some (R5) but not other (R1) SSTR subtypes. We propose that induction by ligand of different oligomeric states of SSTRs represents a unique mechanism for generating signaling specificity not only within the SSTR family but more generally in the HHR family.},

By deconvoluting the images, we demonstrate the existence of phase separation in vivo. We compare the properties of microscopically visible domains ({\textless}1 μm2), with those of isolated detergent-resistant membranes and provide evidence that membrane coverage by lipid rafts and their fluidity are principally governed by cholesterol content, thereby providing strong support for the lipid raft hypothesis.},

The GUV lipid compositions that we examined included 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine, 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC), and 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC) (above their gel-liquid crystal transition temperatures) and two well characterized lipid mixtures, 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DMPE):DMPC (7:3) and 1,2-dilauroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DLPC)/1,2-diarachidoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DAPC) (1:1) equilibrated at their phase-coexistence temperature regime. The membrane fluorescence probes, 6-lauroyl-2-(dimethylamino) napthalene, 6-propionyl-2-(dimethylamino) naphthalene, and rhodamine-phosphatidylethanolamine, were used to assess the state of the membrane and specifically mark the phospholipid domains. Independent of their lipid composition, all GUVs were reduced in size as sPLA2-dependent lipid hydrolysis proceeded. The binding of sPLA2 was monitored using a fluorescein-sPLA2 conjugate. The sPLA2 was observed to associate with the entire surface of the liquid phase in the single phospholipid GUVs. In the mixed-lipid GUV's, at temperatures promoting domain coexistence, a preferential binding of the enzyme to the liquid regions was also found. The lipid phase of the GUV protein binding region was verified by the introduction of 6-propionyl-2-(dimethylamino) naphthalene, which partitions quickly into the lipid fluid phase. Preferential hydrolysis of the liquid domains supported the conclusions based on the binding studies. sPLA2 hydrolyzes the liquid domains in the binary lipid mixtures DLPC:DAPC and DMPC:DMPE, indicating that the solid-phase packing of DAPC and DMPE interferes with sPLA2 binding, irrespective of the phospholipid headgroup. These studies emphasize the importance of lateral packing of the lipids in C. atrox sPLA2 enzymatic hydrolysis of a membrane surface.},

	abstract = {Adenylate kinase (AK) is a ubiquitous enzyme that regulates the homeostasis of adenine nucleotides in the cell. AK1beta (long form) from murine cells shares the same protein sequence as AK1 (short form) except for the addition of 18 amino acid residues at its N-terminus. It is hypothesized that these residues serve as a signal for protein lipid modification and targeting of the protein to the plasma membrane. To better understand the cellular function of these AK isoforms, we have used several modern fluorescence techniques to characterize these two isoforms of AK enzyme. We fused cytosolic adenylate kinase (AK1) and its isoform (AK1beta) with enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) and expressed the chimera proteins in HeLa cells. Using two-photon excitation scanning fluorescence imaging, we were able to directly visualize the localization of AK1-EGFP and AK1beta-EGFP in live cells. AK1beta-EGFP mainly localized on the plasma membrane, whereas AK1-EGFP distributed throughout the cell except for trace amounts in the nuclear membrane and some vesicles. We performed fluorescence correlation spectroscopy measurements and photon-counting histogram analysis in specific domains of live cells. For AK1-EGFP, we observed only one diffusion component in the cytoplasm. For AK1beta-EGFP, we observed two distinct diffusion components on the plasma membrane. One corresponded to the free diffusing protein, whereas the other represented the membrane-bound AK1beta-EGFP. The diffusion rate of AK1-EGFP was slowed by a factor of 1.8 with respect to that of EGFP, which was 50\% more than what we would expect for a free diffusing AK1-EGFP. To rule out the possibility of oligomer formation, we performed photon-counting histogram analysis to direct analyze the brightness difference between AK1-EGFP and EGFP. From our analysis, we concluded that cytoplasmic AK1-EGFP is monomeric. fluorescence correlation spectroscopy proved to be a powerful technique for quantitatively studying the mobility of the target protein in live cells. This technology offers advantages in studying protein interactions and function in the cell.},

PCH has been characterized and applied in vitro, but its potential for in vivo studies needs to be explored. Thus, this study mainly focuses on the characterization of PCH analysis in vivo. The strength of PCH lies in its ability to distinguish biomolecules by their molecular brightness value. Because the concept of molecular brightness is crucial for PCH analysis, we study the molecular brightness of EGFP and determine the statistical accuracy of its measurement under in vivo conditions. We started by characterizing the influence of autofluorescence on EGFP measurements. We found a molecular brightness of EGFP that is a factor of 10 higher than the brightness of the autofluorescence. Moment analysis demonstrates that the contribution of autofluorescence to fluorescence fluctuation experiments is negligible at EGFP concentrations of one protein per excitation volume. The molecular brightness of EGFP measured in the nucleus, the cytoplasm, and in vitro are identical and our study demonstrates that molecular brightness is a very stable and predictable quantity for cellular measurements. In addition to PCH, we also analyzed the autocorrelation function of EGFP. The diffusion coefficient of EGFP is a factor of 3 lower in vivo than compared to in vitro, and a simple diffusion process describes the autocorrelation function. We found that in the nucleus the fluorescence intensity is stable as a function of time, while measurements in the cytoplasm display fluorescence intensity drifts that complicate the data analysis. We introduce and discuss an analysis method that minimizes the influence of the intensity drifts on PCH analysis. This method allows us to recover the correct molecular brightness of EGFP even in the presence of drifts of the fluorescence intensity signal. We found the molecular brightness of EGFP to be a very robust parameter, and anticipate the use of PCH analysis for the study of oligomerization processes in vivo.},

At this position within the capillary, FCS and photon-counting histogram experiments are described by the same equations as used in standard FCS experiments. We report the first experimental realization of fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy under high pressure. A fluorescent dye was used as a model system for evaluating the properties of the capillary under pressure. The autocorrelation function and the photon count distribution were measured in the pressure range from 0 to 300 MPa. The fluctuation amplitude and the diffusion coefficient show a small pressure dependence. The changes of these parameters, which are on the order of 10\%, are due to the pressure changes of the viscosity and the density of the aqueous medium.},

In particular, characteristic properties of the extracellular voltage response such as the waveform and amplitude are not satisfactorily described by electrical circuit models. Here we examine the electrical coupling between a nonmetallized field-effect transistor (FET) and a cell line expressing a voltage-gated EAG K+ channel. The activation kinetics of this channel depends on the voltage pulse protocol and extracellular divalent cations. This feature allows testing, whether the extracellular voltage signal recorded with the FET faithfully tracks the current simultaneously recorded with the patch-clamp technique. We find that the FET signals contain different kinetic components that cannot be entirely explained by equivalent electrical-circuit models. Rather, we suggest that changes in ion concentration in the small cleft between cell and FET may change the surface potential of the FET. This study provides evidence that the electrochemical processes at the cell-transistor interface are complex and that at least two different mechanisms contribute to the shape and amplitude of transistor signals.},

	abstract = {One of the most actively developing areas in fluorescence microscopy is the achievement of spatial resolution below Abbe's diffraction limit, which restricts the resolution to several hundreds of nanometers. Most of the approaches in use at this time require a complex optical setup, a difficult mathematical treatment, or usage of dyes with special photophysical properties. In this work, we present a new, to our knowledge, approach in confocal microscopy that enhances the resolution moderately but is both technically and computationally simple. As it is based on the saturation of the transition from the ground state to the first excited state, it is universally applicable with respect to the dye used. The idea of the method presented is based on a principle similar to that underlying saturation excitation microscopy, but instead of applying harmonically modulated excitation light, the fluorophores are excited by picosecond laser pulses at different intensities, resulting in different levels of saturation. We show that the method can be easily combined with the concept of triplet relaxation, which by tuning the dark periods between pulses helps to suppress the formation of a photolabile triplet state and effectively reduces photobleaching. We demonstrate our approach imaging GFP-labeled protein patches within the plasma membrane of yeast cells.},

Analogous to 2fFCS, the new technique is robust against optical saturation in yielding correct values of the diffusion coefficient. This is in stark contrast to conventional FCS where optical saturation leads to an apparent decrease in the determined diffusion coefficient with increasing excitation power. However, compared to 2fFCS, the new technique is simpler to implement into a conventional confocal microscope setup and is compatible with cw-excitation, only needing as add-ons an electro-optical modulator and a differential interference contrast prism. With pmFCS, the measured diffusion coefficient (D) for Atto655 maleimide in water at 25°C is determined to be equal to (4.09 ± 0.07)×10−6cm2/s, in good agreement with the value of 4.04×10−6cm2/s as measured by 2fFCS.},

	abstract = {Pre-mRNA splicing occurs in two steps. This paper reports studies of protein factor requirements for step 2 catalysis. The studies reveal that the only remodeling of the spliceosome between step 1 and step 2 is mediated by the DEAH-box ATPase Prp16., Step 2 catalysis of pre-mRNA splicing entails the excision of the intron and ligation of the 5′ and 3′ exons. The tasks of the splicing factors Prp16, Slu7, Prp18, and Prp22 in the formation of the step 2 active site of the spliceosome and in exon ligation, and the timing of their recruitment, remain poorly understood. Using a purified yeast in vitro splicing system, we show that only the DEAH-box ATPase Prp16 is required for formation of a functional step 2 active site and for exon ligation. Efficient docking of the 3′ splice site (3′SS) to the active site requires only Slu7/Prp18 but not Prp22. Spliceosome remodeling by Prp16 appears to be subtle as only the step 1 factor Cwc25 is dissociated prior to step 2 catalysis, with its release dependent on docking of the 3′SS to the active site and Prp16 action. We show by fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy that Slu7/Prp18 and Prp16 bind early to distinct, low-affinity binding sites on the step-1-activated B* spliceosome, which are subsequently converted into high-affinity sites. Our results shed new light on the factor requirements for step 2 catalysis and the dynamics of step 1 and 2 factors during the catalytic steps of splicing.},

	abstract = {Protein diffusion in lipid membranes is a key aspect of many cellular signaling processes. To quantitatively describe protein diffusion in membranes, several competing theoretical models have been proposed. Among these, the Saffman-Delbrück model is the most famous. This model predicts a logarithmic dependence of a protein’s diffusion coefficient on its inverse hydrodynamic radius (D ∝ ln 1/R) for small radius values. For large radius values, it converges toward a D ∝ 1/R scaling. Recently, however, experimental data indicate a Stokes-Einstein-like behavior (D ∝ 1/R) of membrane protein diffusion at small protein radii. In this study, we investigate protein diffusion in black lipid membranes using dual-focus fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. This technique yields highly accurate diffusion coefficients for lipid and protein diffusion in membranes. We find that despite its simplicity, the Saffman-Delbrück model is able to describe protein diffusion extremely well and a Stokes-Einstein-like behavior can be ruled out.},

	abstract = {Fluorescence microscopy is an enormously powerful tool for investigating structural organization and dynamical processes on the cellular level because of its noninvasiveness, sensitivity, and specificity. However, classical fluorescence microscopy is limited in resolution by the diffraction of light. In recent years, structural illumination microscopy has succeeded in doubling this resolution without requiring any special sample preparation or labeling dyes. However, it is technically very challenging and complex. Here, we present an alternative that achieves the same resolution enhancement by using a standard confocal spinning-disk microscope with minimal modifications. This method, in principle, allows one to double the resolution of any existing confocal microscope., We demonstrate how a conventional confocal spinning-disk (CSD) microscope can be converted into a doubly resolving image scanning microscopy (ISM) system without changing any part of its optical or mechanical elements. Making use of the intrinsic properties of a CSD microscope, we illuminate stroboscopically, generating an array of excitation foci that are moved across the sample by varying the phase between stroboscopic excitation and rotation of the spinning disk. ISM then generates an image with nearly doubled resolution. Using conventional fluorophores, we have imaged single nuclear pore complexes in the nuclear membrane and aggregates of GFP-conjugated Tau protein in three dimensions. Multicolor ISM was shown on cytoskeletal-associated structural proteins and on 3D four-color images including MitoTracker and Hoechst staining. The simple adaptation of conventional CSD equipment allows superresolution investigations of a broad variety of cell biological questions.},

	abstract = {The sea urchin sperm guanylyl cyclase chemoreceptor achieves ultrasensitive signal detection and precise signal modulation through high receptor density, subnanomolar ligand affinity, and sequential dephosphorylation., Guanylyl cyclases (GCs), which synthesize the messenger cyclic guanosine 3′,5′-monophosphate, control several sensory functions, such as phototransduction, chemosensation, and thermosensation, in many species from worms to mammals. The GC chemoreceptor in sea urchin sperm can decode chemoattractant concentrations with single-molecule sensitivity. The molecular and cellular underpinnings of such ultrasensitivity are not known for any eukaryotic chemoreceptor. In this paper, we show that an exquisitely high density of 3 × 105 GC chemoreceptors and subnanomolar ligand affinity provide a high ligand-capture efficacy and render sperm perfect absorbers. The GC activity is terminated within 150 ms by dephosphorylation steps of the receptor, which provides a means for precise control of the GC lifetime and which reduces “molecule noise.” Compared with other ultrasensitive sensory systems, the 10-fold signal amplification by the GC receptor is surprisingly low. The hallmarks of this signaling mechanism provide a blueprint for chemical sensing in small compartments, such as olfactory cilia, insect antennae, or even synaptic boutons.},

Previously, three-dimensional (3D) SOFI has been demonstrated by sequential imaging of multiple depth positions. Here we introduce a multiplexed imaging scheme for the simultaneous acquisition of multiple focal planes. Using 3D cross-cumulants, we show that the depth sampling can be increased. The simultaneous acquisition of multiple focal planes significantly reduces the acquisition time and thus the photobleaching. We demonstrate multiplane 3D SOFI by imaging fluorescently labelled cells over an imaged volume of up to 65 × 65 × 3.5 μm3 without depth scanning. In particular, we image the 3D network of mitochondria in fixed C2C12 cells immunostained with Alexa 647 fluorophores and the 3D vimentin structure in living Hela cells expressing the fluorescent protein Dreiklang., 
Super-resolution optical fluctuation imaging provides 3D images of biological specimens via blinking fluorophores.

Transport through the pore is restricted by a hydrophobic selectivity filter comprising disordered phenylalanine-glycine-rich repeats of nuclear pore proteins. Exchange through the pore requires specialized transport receptors, called exportins and importins, that interact with cargo proteins in a RanGTP-dependent manner. These receptors are highly flexible superhelical structures composed of HEAT-repeat motifs that adopt various degrees of extension in crystal structures. Here, we performed molecular-dynamics simulations using crystal structures of Importin-β in its free form or in complex with nuclear localization signal peptides as the starting conformation. Our simulations predicted that initially compact structures would adopt extended conformations in hydrophilic buffers, while contracted conformations would dominate in more hydrophobic solutions, mimicking the environment of the nuclear pore. We confirmed this experimentally by Förster resonance energy transfer experiments using dual-fluorophore-labeled Importin-β. These observations explain seemingly contradictory crystal structures and suggest a possible mechanism for cargo protection during passage of the nuclear pore. Such hydrophobic switching may be a general principle for environmental control of protein function.},

Here, we show that the distribution of the multifunctional DEAH-box RNA helicase Prp43 between its diverse cellular functions can be regulated by the interplay of its G-patch protein cofactors. We identify the orphan G-patch protein Cmg1 (YLR271W) as a novel cofactor of Prp43 and show that it stimulates the RNA binding and ATPase activity of the helicase. Interestingly, Cmg1 localizes to the cytoplasm and to the intermembrane space of mitochondria and its overexpression promotes apoptosis. Furthermore, our data reveal that different G-patch protein cofactors compete for interaction with Prp43. Changes in the expression levels of Prp43-interacting G-patch proteins modulate the cellular localization of Prp43 and G-patch protein overexpression causes accumulation of the helicase in the cytoplasm or nucleoplasm. Overexpression of several G-patch proteins also leads to defects in ribosome biogenesis that are consistent with withdrawal of the helicase from this pathway. Together, these findings suggest that the availability of cofactors and the sequestering of the helicase are means to regulate the activity of multifunctional RNA helicases and their distribution between different cellular processes.},

	abstract = {Human immunodeficiency virus t﻿ype 1 (H﻿IV-1) assembles as immature particles, which require the proteolytic cleavage of structural polyprotein Gag and the clustering of envelope glycoprotein Env for infectivity. The details of mechanisms underlying Env clustering remain unknown. Here, we determine molecular dynamics of Env on the surface of individual HIV-1 particles using scanning fluorescence correlation spectroscopy on a super-resolution STED microscope. We find that Env undergoes a maturation-induced increase in mobility, highlighting diffusion as one cause for Env clustering. This mobility increase is dependent on Gag-interacting Env tail but not on changes in viral envelope lipid order. Diffusion of Env and other envelope incorporated proteins in mature HIV-1 is two orders of magnitude slower than in the plasma membrane, indicating that HIV-1 envelope is intrinsically a low mobility environment, mainly due to its general high lipid order. Our results provide insights into dynamic properties of proteins on the surface of individual virus particles., To become infectious, HIV-1 particles undergo a maturation process involving the clustering of envelope glycoprotein Env. Here, Chojnacki et al. employ super-resolution STED-FCS microscopy to study dynamics of Env molecules on HIV-1 particles and show that Env undergoes a maturation-induced increase in mobility.},

In the present study, we demonstrate that the metabolic sensing kinase AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase) phosphorylates NKCC2 on Ser126 in vitro. Co-precipitation experiments indicated that there is a physical association between AMPK and the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of NKCC2. Activation of AMPK in the MMDD1 (mouse macula densa-derived 1) cell line resulted in an increase in Ser126 phosphorylation in situ, suggesting that AMPK may phosphorylate NKCC2 in vivo. The functional significance of Ser126 phosphorylation was examined by mutating the serine residue to an alanine residue resulting in a marked reduction in co-transporter activity when exogenously expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes under isotonic conditions. Under hypertonic conditions no significant change of activity was observed. Therefore the present study identifies a novel phosphorylation site that maintains NKCC2-mediated transport under isotonic or basal conditions. Moreover, the metabolic-sensing kinase, AMPK, is able to phosphorylate this site, potentially linking the cellular energy state with changes in co-transporter activity.},

	abstract = {Background
The glaucomas are generally asymptomatic diseases until they are very advanced. They affect 2\% of the population over 40 years of age and therefore represent a significant public health issue. There have been a number of attempts to develop quality of life scales for the disease. This review discusses the pros and cons of these scales and suggests the best of the current ones for use in a clinical setting.

Methods
Medline, Embase and Google Scholar were searched for relevant articles. No time period was defined and all types of article were included.

Results
11 Quality of Life scores were identified that have been used with glaucoma patients.

Conclusion
There is no generally accepted 'best' Quality of Life instrument for use in glaucoma. Many of the scales are biased towards physical symptoms and do little to address the personal or social factors of the disease. Further work is needed to produce scales that address all these areas as well as being simple to administer in a clinical setting.},

Here, we describe a simple strategy for probing microscopic fluid flows in vivo that meets this challenge. An all-optical procedure combining femtosecond laser ablation, fast confocal microscopy and 3D-particle tracking was devised to label, image and quantify the flow. This approach is illustrated by studying the flow generated within a micrometer scale ciliated vesicle located deep inside the zebrafish embryo and involved in breaking left-right embryonic symmetry. By mapping the velocity field within the vesicle and surrounding a single beating cilium, we show this method can address the dynamics of cilia-driven flows at multiple length scales, and can validate the flow features as predicted from previous simulations. This approach provides new experimental access to questions of microscopic fluid dynamics in vivo.},

	issn = {1177-5467},
	url = {https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2694017/},
	abstract = {Background
We aimed to compare visual and refractive outcome following phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implant (IOL) and combined one-site phacotrabeculectomy.

Method
We performed a retrospective study of case records of patients who had temporal incision phacoemulsification with IOL or one-site phacotrabeculectomy, between June 1997 and June 2001. The patients were matched for age group, operating list and IOL type. All patients were operated on under local anesthesia by the same surgeon. Each arm of the study had 90 patients, age range 60 to 75 years. We collected pre- and postoperative visual acuity, pre- and postoperative refraction within six months after surgery, and intended refraction. The intraocular pressure control was not recorded, as it was not the aim of our study.

Results
In the phacotrabeculectomy group, 76.6\% of patients achieved aimed spherical equivalent, 15.5\% of patients had against-the-rule (ATR) astigmatism induced by the surgery, and 90\% of the patients had best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) more than 6/12. In the temporal incision phacoemulsification group, 81.1\% of patients achieved aimed spherical equivalent, 10\% of the patients had induced ATR by the surgery and 95.55\% of patients achieved BCVA more than 6/12.

Conclusion
In this study the visual outcome of the phacotrabeculectomy group did not differ significantly from the visual outcome of temporal approach phacoemulsification.},

	abstract = {Aims:
To evaluate the effectiveness of a new test, the Pupilmetrix™ PLR60, which uses the pupillary light reflex (PLR) to detect asymmetric retinal damage in patients diagnosed with glaucoma.

Methods:
30 patients, clinically diagnosed as having glaucoma, were recruited to the study, 29 of whom completed testing using the PLR60. A control group of 30 patients who had glaucoma excluded by clinical examination were also recruited and tested using the same protocol on the PLR60.

Results:
Of the 110 eyes with test outcomes, overall agreement between the PLR60 result and clinical diagnosis (glaucoma positive or negative) per eye was 84.7\%. Sensitivity was 93.1\% (95\% CI 77.2\%–99.2\%) and specificity was 76.7\% (95\% CI 57.7\%–90.1\%). Average (SD) test times (min:sec) for both eyes were 3:21 (0:33) minutes for the glaucoma group and 2:40 (0:35) minutes for the non-glaucoma group.

Conclusions:
The results of this preliminary study suggest that the PLR as used in the Pupilmetrix™ PLR60 test is able to discriminate between patients with glaucomatous retinal defects and those with clinically normal retinas with a diagnostic accuracy that is potentially useful for screening for glaucoma. Test times were markedly quicker than with standard visual field testing.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE
There is evidence of gut barrier and immune system dysfunction in some patients with type 1 diabetes, possibly linked with exposure to dietary wheat polypeptides (WP). However, questions arise regarding the frequency of abnormal immune responses to wheat and their nature, and it remains unclear whether such responses are diabetes specific.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
In type 1 diabetic patients and healthy control subjects, the immune response of peripheral CD3+ T-cells to WPs, ovalbumin, gliadin, α-gliadin 33-mer peptide, tetanus toxoid, and phytohemagglutinin was measured using a carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE) proliferation assay. T–helper cell type 1 (Th1), Th2, and Th17 cytokines were analyzed in WP-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMNC) supernatants, and HLA was analyzed by PCR.

RESULTS
Of 42 patients, 20 displayed increased CD3+ T-cell proliferation to WPs and were classified as responders; proliferative responses to other dietary antigens were less pronounced. WP-stimulated PBMNCs from patients showed a mixed proinflammatory cytokine response with large amounts of IFN-γ, IL-17A, and increased TNF. HLA-DQ2, the major celiac disease risk gene, was not significantly different. Nearly all responders carried the diabetes risk gene HLA-DR4. Anti-DR antibodies blocked the WP response and inhibited secretion of Th1 and Th17 cytokines. High amounts of WP-stimulated IL-6 were not blocked.

CONCLUSIONS
T-cell reactivity to WPs was frequently present in type 1 diabetic patients and associated with HLA-DR4 but not HLA-DQ2. The presence of an HLA-DR–restricted Th1 and Th17 response to WPs in a subset of patients indicates a diabetes-related inflammatory state in the gut immune tissues associated with defective oral tolerance and possibly gut barrier dysfunction.},

	abstract = {In contrast to the classical assumption that neural crest cells are induced in chick as the neural folds elevate, recent data suggest that they are already specified during gastrulation. This prompted us to map the origin of the neural crest and dorsal neural tube in the early avian embryo. Using a combination of focal dye injections and time-lapse imaging, we find that neural crest and dorsal neural tube precursors are present in a broad, crescent-shaped region of the gastrula. Surprisingly, static fate maps together with dynamic confocal imaging reveal that the neural plate border is considerably broader and extends more caudally than expected. Interestingly, we find that the position of the presumptive neural crest broadly correlates with the BMP4 expression domain from gastrula to neurula stages. Some degree of rostrocaudal patterning, albeit incomplete, is already evident in the gastrula. Time-lapse imaging studies show that the neural crest and dorsal neural tube precursors undergo choreographed movements that follow a spatiotemporal progression and include convergence and extension, reorientation, cell intermixing, and motility deep within the embryo. Through these rearrangement and reorganization movements, the neural crest and dorsal neural tube precursors become regionally segregated, coming to occupy predictable rostrocaudal positions along the embryonic axis. This regionalization occurs progressively and appears to be complete in the neurula by stage 7 at levels rostral to Hensen's node.},

	abstract = {Background
Exposure to dietary wheat proteins in genetically susceptible individuals has been associated with increased risk for the development of Type 1 diabetes (T1D). Recently, a wheat protein encoded by cDNA WP5212 has been shown to be antigenic in mice, rats and humans with autoimmune T1D. To investigate the genomic origin of the identified wheat protein cDNA, a hexaploid wheat genomic library from Glenlea cultivar was screened.

Results
Three unique wheat globulin genes, Glo-3A, Glo3-B and Glo-3C, were identified. We describe the genomic structure of these genes and their expression pattern in wheat seeds. The Glo-3A gene shared 99\% identity with the cDNA of WP5212 at the nucleotide and deduced amino acid level, indicating that we have identified the gene(s) encoding wheat protein WP5212. Southern analysis revealed the presence of multiple copies of Glo-3-like sequences in all wheat samples, including hexaploid, tetraploid and diploid species wheat seed. Aleurone and embryo tissue specificity of WP5212 gene expression, suggested by promoter region analysis, which demonstrated an absence of endosperm specific cis elements, was confirmed by immunofluorescence microscopy using anti-WP5212 antibodies.

Conclusion
Taken together, the results indicate that a diverse group of globulins exists in wheat, some of which could be associated with the pathogenesis of T1D in some susceptible individuals. These data expand our knowledge of specific wheat globulins and will enable further elucidation of their role in wheat biology and human health.},

	abstract = {The directionality of local blood flow in the zebrafish embryonic heart is essential for proper heart valve formation., Heart valve anomalies are some of the most common congenital heart defects, yet neither the genetic nor the epigenetic forces guiding heart valve development are well understood. When functioning normally, mature heart valves prevent intracardiac retrograde blood flow; before valves develop, there is considerable regurgitation, resulting in reversing (or oscillatory) flows between the atrium and ventricle. As reversing flows are particularly strong stimuli to endothelial cells in culture, an attractive hypothesis is that heart valves form as a developmental response to retrograde blood flows through the maturing heart. Here, we exploit the relationship between oscillatory flow and heart rate to manipulate the amount of retrograde flow in the atrioventricular (AV) canal before and during valvulogenesis, and find that this leads to arrested valve growth. Using this manipulation, we determined that klf2a is normally expressed in the valve precursors in response to reversing flows, and is dramatically reduced by treatments that decrease such flows. Experimentally knocking down the expression of this shear-responsive gene with morpholine antisense oligonucleotides (MOs) results in dysfunctional valves. Thus, klf2a expression appears to be necessary for normal valve formation. This, together with its dependence on intracardiac hemodynamic forces, makes klf2a expression an early and reliable indicator of proper valve development. Together, these results demonstrate a critical role for reversing flows during valvulogenesis and show how relatively subtle perturbations of normal hemodynamic patterns can lead to both major alterations in gene expression and severe valve dysgenesis., The growth and development of vertebrates are critically dependent on efficient cardiac output to drive blood circulation. An essential step of heart development is the formation of heart valves, whose leaflets are made through a complex set of cellular rearrangements of endothelial cells. Endothelial cells experience high flow forces as blood circulates. Moreover, heart valves and associated structures can be malformed when flow forces are abnormal, suggesting that these flow forces are in fact required for proper valve formation. Whether it is the force of the blood flow, its directionality (forward or reverse), or both that are important is not clear. We studied the interplay during valve development between key genes known to be involved in the process and epigenetic influences such as flow forces. Using zebrafish, whose optical clarity allows analyzing blood flow patterns at high resolution, we identified the presence of reversing flows specifically at the level of valve precursors. By manipulating blood flow patterns, we show that reversing flows are essential for valve morphogenesis. Specifically, we show that the expression of the gene klf2a depends on the presence of reversing flows and is required for valve development. We predict that by influencing levels of klf2a, reversing flows constitute an important stimulus controlling the appropriate biological responses of endothelial cells during valve formation.},

The purposes of this study were to quantitatively examine hip abductor strength in patients presenting with iliotibial band friction syndrome (ITBFS) and to determine whether a multi-modal physiotherapy approach, including hip abductor strengthening, might play a role in recovery.

Method:
Our observational, pretest–posttest study is one of the first prospective studies in this area. Patients presenting to physiotherapy with unilateral ITBFS were recruited to participate. Participants followed a 6-week rehabilitation programme designed to strengthen hip abductors; strength was measured every 2 weeks using a hand-held dynamometer and compared bilaterally.

Results:
Sixteen subjects (five men, 11 women) aged 20 to 53 years participated. All but 2 reported running as one of their main physical activities. A trend toward a significant difference in hip abductor strength was found between the injured and uninjured sides at baseline, but this difference disappeared by 6 weeks. Hip abductor strength was significantly related to physical function at weeks 2, 4, and 6. Nine subjects were discharged from physiotherapy after the 6-week period, while the other 7 subjects continued attending for up to 5 months.

Conclusions:
Hip abductor strengthening appeared to be beneficial in the treatment of ITBFS, but further research on the use of hip abductor strengthening for treatment and prevention of ITBFS is needed.},

We confirmed the functionality of the clone by expressing it in human embryonic kidney cells and performing radiotracer experiments and whole-cell patch-clamp recordings. By using short interfering RNAs targeting different parts of the sequence, we confirmed that the cloned protein is the main prostatic transporter responsible for citrate release. We also produced a specific antibody and localized the cloned transporter protein to the plasma membrane of the cells.

Here, we demonstrate that second harmonic generating (SHG) nanoprobes can be used for in vivo imaging, circumventing many of the limitations of classical fluorescence probes. Under intense illumination, such as at the focus of a laser-scanning microscope, these SHG nanocrystals convert two photons into one photon of half the wavelength; thus, when imaged by conventional two-photon microscopy, SHG nanoprobes appear to generate a signal with an inverse Stokes shift like a fluorescent dye, but with a narrower emission. Unlike commonly used fluorescent probes, SHG nanoprobes neither bleach nor blink, and the signal they generate does not saturate with increasing illumination intensity. The resulting contrast and detectability of SHG nanoprobes provide unique advantages for molecular imaging of living cells and tissues.},

	abstract = {Background
One of the least understood and most central questions confronting biologists is how initially simple clusters or sheet-like cell collectives can assemble into highly complex three-dimensional functional tissues and organs. Due to the limits of oxygen diffusion, blood vessels are an essential and ubiquitous presence in all amniote tissues and organs. Vasculogenesis, the de novo self-assembly of endothelial cell (EC) precursors into endothelial tubes, is the first step in blood vessel formation . Static imaging and in vitro models are wholly inadequate to capture many aspects of vascular pattern formation in vivo, because vasculogenesis involves dynamic changes of the endothelial cells and of the forming blood vessels, in an embryo that is changing size and shape.

Methodology/Principal Findings
We have generated Tie1 transgenic quail lines Tg(tie1:H2B-eYFP) that express H2B-eYFP in all of their endothelial cells which permit investigations into early embryonic vascular morphogenesis with unprecedented clarity and insight. By combining the power of molecular genetics with the elegance of dynamic imaging, we follow the precise patterning of endothelial cells in space and time. We show that during vasculogenesis within the vascular plexus, ECs move independently to form the rudiments of blood vessels, all while collectively moving with gastrulating tissues that flow toward the embryo midline. The aortae are a composite of somatic derived ECs forming its dorsal regions and the splanchnic derived ECs forming its ventral region. The ECs in the dorsal regions of the forming aortae exhibit variable mediolateral motions as they move rostrally; those in more ventral regions show significant lateral-to-medial movement as they course rostrally.

Conclusions/Significance
The present results offer a powerful approach to the major challenge of studying the relative role(s) of the mechanical, molecular, and cellular mechanisms of vascular development. In past studies, the advantages of the molecular genetic tools available in mouse were counterbalanced by the limited experimental accessibility needed for imaging and perturbation studies. Avian embryos provide the needed accessibility, but few genetic resources. The creation of transgenic quail with labeled endothelia builds upon the important roles that avian embryos have played in previous studies of vascular development.},

Less is known about apical-to-basolateral transcytosis, the direction the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) transports maternal IgGs across intestinal epithelia. To compare apical-to-basolateral and basolateral-to-apical transcytosis, we co-expressed FcRn and pIgR in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells and used pulse-chase experiments with confocal microscopy to examine transport of apically applied IgG Fcγ and basolaterally applied pIgA. Fcγ and pIgA trafficking routes were initially separate but intermixed at later chase times. Fcγ was first localized near the apical surface, but became more equally distributed across the cell, consistent with concomitant transcytosis and recycling. By contrast, pIgA transport was strongly unidirectional: pIgA shifted from near the basolateral surface to an apical location with increasing time. Some Fcγ and pIgA fluorescence colocalized in early (EEA1-positive), recycling (Rab11a-positive), and transferrin (Tf)-positive common/basolateral recycling endosomes. Fcγ became more enriched in Tf-positive endosomes with time, whereas pIgA was sorted from these compartments. Live-cell imaging revealed that vesicles containing Fcγ or pIgA shared similar mobility characteristics and were equivalently affected by depolymerizing microtubules, indicating that both trafficking routes depended to roughly the same extent on intact microtubules.},

	abstract = {Purpose:
To determine the effect of viscogonioplasty and cataract extraction on intraocular pressure in patients with narrow angle glaucoma.

Methods:
This was a double-masked randomized controlled trial involving 50 eyes (25 cases and 25 controls) from 38 consecutive patients. All patients underwent phacoemulsification with or without viscogonioplasty. The main outcome measures were intraocular pressure post-treatment and number of glaucoma medications post-treatment.

Results:
Cases had a greater reduction in intraocular pressure than controls, with a mean intraocular pressure (standard deviation) at 12 months of 13.7 (±2.89) mmHg compared with 16.2 (±3.55) mmHg in controls (P = 0.009). Cases had a greater reduction in mean number of antiglaucoma medications than controls at 12-month review, with 13 of 25 eyes (52\%) of cases controlled without any antiglaucoma therapy versus 9 of 25 (36\%) of the controls (P = 0.005).

Conclusions:
Viscogonioplasty combined with cataract extraction has a significantly greater effect than cataract extraction alone on lowering intraocular pressure in patients with poorly controlled narrow angle glaucoma and should therefore be considered as a treatment option for patients with this condition.},

Removal of this population after neural tube closure results in severe septation defects in the chick, reminiscent of human birth defects. Because neural crest cells from other axial levels have regenerative capacity, we asked whether the cardiac neural crest might also regenerate at early stages in a manner that declines with time. Accordingly, we find that ablation of presumptive cardiac crest at stage 7, as the neural folds elevate, results in reformation of migrating cardiac neural crest by stage 13. Fate mapping reveals that the new population derives largely from the neuroepithelium ventral and rostral to the ablation. The stage of ablation dictates the competence of residual tissue to regulate and regenerate, as this capacity is lost by stage 9, consistent with previous reports. These findings suggest that there is a temporal window during which the presumptive cardiac neural crest has the capacity to regulate and regenerate, but this regenerative ability is lost earlier than in other neural crest populations.},

To date, autoimmune T-cell response and antibody reactivity to more than 20 autoantigens have been linked to this disease. Some studies have described the intermediate filament protein peripherin (PRPH) as an autoantigen associated with T1D in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice. We evaluated immune reactivity of mouse and rabbit sera and human plasma to a 58 kDa protein expressed in RIN-m5F rat insulinoma cells. The protein was isolated using 2-DE and identified by mass spectrometry as PRPH. Antibodies from healthy humans and T1D patients, CD-1 mice, C57BL/6 mice, NOR (non-obese diabetes resistant) mice, and NOD mice reacted with PRPH on Western blots. However, antibody response to PRPH was stronger in NOD than non-autoimmune prone C57BL/6 mice. We conclude that immune reactivity to PRPH is not exclusively associated with NOD mice or human patients with T1D. Furthermore, the frequent occurrence of PRPH-reactive antibodies in mouse and human blood suggests that binding may be non-specific or could reflect the presence of natural autoantibodies against PRPH. These findings point to the need for a re-evaluation of PRPH as a T1D autoantigen in NOD mice and raise the question of the physiological relevance of such widespread immune reactivity against this peripheral nervous system protein.},

	abstract = {Objective
Celiac Disease (CD) is an autoimmune disease triggered by exposure to gluten containing foods. IgA autoantibodies to tissue transglutaminase (TTG) are elevated in CD, but little is known about the gastrointestinal state prior to the appearance of TTG. Antibodies to wheat storage globulin Glo-3A have been studied in type 1 diabetes (T1D), and may be a marker of altered mucosal barrier and/or immune function. In this study, we investigated antibody responses to Glo-3A in CD.

Methods
In the Diabetes Autoimmunity Study in the Young (DAISY), children are followed prospectively from birth for the appearance of TTG and CD. 50 cases of CD were frequency-matched with 50 controls on age (of TTG seroconversion in the case), gender, ethnicity, presence of a first degree relative with T1D, and HLA-DR3 genotype. In cases and controls, IgG antibodies to Glo-3A were analyzed in a blinded manner in the sample collected at the time of seroconversion to TTG positivity (or the matched sample in controls) and in all previous samples since birth (mean: 4.5 samples). The association between Glo-3A antibody levels and CD case status was explored using t-tests at the TTG positive visit and when Glo-3A levels were highest and mixed modeling to describe Glo-3A over time.

Results
At the time of first elevated TTG (mean 4.9 years), CD cases had higher Glo-3A antibody levels than controls (13.3±17.2 versus 7.6±11.7, p = 0.005). In both cases and controls, Glo-3A antibodies appear to peak at a mean age of 2.9 years, prior to mean age of initial TTG seroconversion. The peak Glo-3A antibody levels were higher in cases than controls a (25.5±21.8 versus 14.9±18.3 p = 0.0007). Using mixed modeling to account for multiple visits per person, cases had higher levels of Glo-3A antibodies than controls at all ages from birth to TTG seroconversion (β = 0.53, p = 0.002).

Conclusion
Compared to controls, CD cases have higher Glo-3A antibody responses beginning years prior to initial detection of TTG.},

Here, we report a multiplexed fluorescent in situ hybridization method based on orthogonal amplification with hybridization chain reactions (HCR) . Using this approach, RNA probes complementary to mRNA targets trigger chain reactions in which fluorophore-labeled RNA hairpins self-assemble into tethered fluorescent amplification polymers. The programmability and sequence specificity of these amplification cascades enable multiple HCR amplifiers to operate orthogonally at the same time in the same sample. Robust performance is achieved when imaging five target mRNAs simultaneously in fixed whole-mount and sectioned zebrafish embryos. HCR amplifiers exhibit excellent sample penetration, high signal-to-background, and sharp signal localization.},

Sensitivity is sufficient to resolve shifts caused by binding of individual nanobeads in solution down to a record radius of 12.5 nm, a size approaching that of single protein molecules. A histogram of wavelength shift versus nanoparticle radius shows that particle size can be inferred from shift maxima. Additionally, the signal-to-noise ratio for detection of Influenza A virus is enhanced to 38∶1 from the previously reported 3∶1. The method does not use feedback stabilization of the probe laser. It is also observed that the conjunction of particle-induced backscatter and optical-path-induced shifts can be used to enhance detection signal-to-noise.},

	abstract = {Voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) activity has previously been reported in endothelial cells (ECs). However, the exact isoforms of VGSCs present, their mode(s) of action, and potential role(s) in angiogenesis have not been investigated. The main aims of this study were to determine the role of VGSC activity in angiogenic functions and to elucidate the potentially associated signaling mechanisms using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) as a model system. Real-time PCR showed that the primary functional VGSC α- and β-subunit isoforms in HUVECs were Nav1.5, Nav1.7, VGSCβ1, and VGSCβ3. Western blots verified that VGSCα proteins were expressed in HUVECs, and immunohistochemistry revealed VGSCα expression in mouse aortic ECs in vivo. Electrophysiological recordings showed that the channels were functional and suppressed by tetrodotoxin (TTX). VGSC activity modulated the following angiogenic properties of HUVECs: VEGF-induced proliferation or chemotaxis, tubular differentiation, and substrate adhesion. Interestingly, different aspects of angiogenesis were controlled by the different VGSC isoforms based on TTX sensitivity and effects of siRNA-mediated gene silencing. Additionally, we show for the first time that TTX-resistant (TTX-R) VGSCs (Nav1.5) potentiate VEGF-induced ERK1/2 activation through the PKCα-B-RAF signaling axis. We postulate that this potentiation occurs through modulation of VEGF-induced HUVEC depolarization and [Ca2+]i. We conclude that VGSCs regulate multiple angiogenic functions and VEGF signaling in HUVECs. Our results imply that targeting VGSC expression/activity could be a novel strategy for controlling angiogenesis.},

To better study the morphological features of cells during gastrulation, we generated mosaic embryos expressing membrane attached Dendra2 to highlight cellular boundaries. We find that intercellular bridges join a significant fraction of epiblast cells in the zebrafish embryo, reaching several cell diameters in length and spanning across different regions of the developing embryos. These intercellular bridges are distinct from the cellular protrusions previously reported as extending from hypoblast cells (1–2 cellular diameters in length) or epiblast cells (which were shorter). Most of the intercellular bridges were formed at pre-gastrula stages by the daughters of a dividing cell maintaining a membrane tether as they move apart after mitosis. These intercellular bridges persist during gastrulation and can mediate the transfer of proteins between distant cells. These findings reveal a surprising feature of the cellular landscape in zebrafish embryos and open new possibilities for cell-cell communication during gastrulation, with implications for modeling, cellular mechanics, and morphogenetic signaling.},

Currently fundus fluorescein angiography (FA) is the standard technique in clinical settings for visualizing blood circulation of the retina. High contrast imaging of retinal vasculature is achieved by injection of a fluorescein dye into the systemic circulation. We previously reported phase-variance optical coherence tomography (pvOCT) as an alternative and non-invasive technique to image human retinal capillaries. In contrast to FA, pvOCT allows not only noninvasive visualization of a two-dimensional retinal perfusion map but also volumetric morphology of retinal microvasculature with high sensitivity. In this paper we report high-speed acquisition at 125 kHz A-scans with pvOCT to reduce motion artifacts and increase the scanning area when compared with previous reports. Two scanning schemes with different sampling densities and scanning areas are evaluated to find optimal parameters for high acquisition speed in vivo imaging. In order to evaluate this technique, we compare pvOCT capillary imaging at 3x3 mm2 and 1.5x1.5 mm2 with fundus FA for a normal human subject. Additionally, a volumetric view of retinal capillaries and a stitched image acquired with ten 3x3 mm2 pvOCT sub-volumes are presented. Visualization of retinal vasculature with pvOCT has potential for diagnosis of retinal vascular diseases.},

Rat jejunum and pancreas, as well as human duodenum and monocytes were probed, and binding was evaluated by immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy.

Blood monocytes and macrophage-like cells in human duodenum were also labelled with the enriched antibodies. Blocking studies revealed that binding to CD163+ macrophages was not due to cross-reactivity with anti-Glo-3A antibodies, but rather to non-Glo-3A antibodies co-purified during antibody enrichment.

Our studies focus on differential induction of heart fate in the basal chordate Ciona intestinalis. We have found that differential induction does not simply reflect differential exposure to the inductive signal. Instead, pre-cardiac cells employ polarized, invasive protrusions to localize their response to an ungraded signal. Through targeted manipulation of the cytoskeletal regulator CDC42, we are able to de-polarize protrusive activity and generate uniform heart progenitor fate specification. Furthermore, we are able to restore differential induction by re-polarizing protrusive activity. These findings illustrate how bi-directional interactions between intercellular signaling and the cytoskeleton can influence embryonic development. In particular, these studies highlight the potential for dynamic cytoskeletal changes to refine cell fate specification in response to crude signal gradients.},

The technique was validated by a large-scale production screen that identified a collection of 170 FlipTrap lines. This novel gene trap has multiple capacities and allows for visualization of a functional proteome and interrogation of the function of the proteome., We report a multifunctional gene-trapping approach, which generates full-length Citrine fusions with endogenous proteins and conditional mutants from a single integration event of the FlipTrap vector. We identified 170 FlipTrap zebrafish lines with diverse tissue-specific expression patterns and distinct subcellular localizations of fusion proteins generated by the integration of an internal citrine exon. Cre-mediated conditional mutagenesis is enabled by heterotypic lox sites that delete Citrine and “flip” in its place mCherry with a polyadenylation signal, resulting in a truncated fusion protein. Inducing recombination with Cerulean-Cre results in fusion proteins that often mislocalize, exhibit mutant phenotypes, and dramatically knock down wild-type transcript levels. FRT sites in the vector enable targeted genetic manipulation of the trapped loci in the presence of Flp recombinase. Thus, the FlipTrap captures the functional proteome, enabling the visualization of full-length fluorescent fusion proteins and interrogation of function by conditional mutagenesis and targeted genetic manipulation.},

	abstract = {Aim
Activation of the master energy-regulator AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in the heart reduces the severity of ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) but the role of AMPK in renal IRI is not known. The aim of this study was to determine whether activation of AMPK by acute renal ischemia influences the severity of renal IRI.

Methods
AMPK expression and activation and the severity of renal IRI was studied in mice lacking the AMPK β1 subunit and compared to wild type (WT) mice.

Results
Basal expression of activated AMPK, phosphorylayed at αThr172, was markedly reduced by 96\% in AMPK-β1−/− mice. Acute renal ischaemia caused a 3.2-fold increase in α1-AMPK activity and a 2.5-fold increase in α2-AMPK activity (P{\textless}0.001) that was associated with an increase in AMPK phosphorylation of the AMPK-α subunit at Thr172 and Ser485, and increased inhibitory phosphorylation of the AMPK substrate acetyl-CoA carboxylase. After acute renal ischemia AMPK activity was reduced by 66\% in AMPK-β1−/− mice compared with WT. There was no difference, however, in the severity of renal IRI at 24-hours between AMPK-β1−/− and WT mice, as measured by serum urea and creatinine and histological injury score. In the heart, macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) released during IRI contributes to AMPK activation and protects from injury. In the kidney, however, no difference in AMPK activation by acute ischemia was observed between MIF−/− and WT mice. Compared with the heart, expression of the MIF receptor CD74 was found to be reduced in the kidney.

Conclusion
The failure of AMPK activation to influence the outcome of IRI in the kidney contrasts with what is reported in the heart. This difference might be due to a lack of effect of MIF on AMPK activation and lower CD74 expression in the kidney.},

	abstract = {Background
Elucidating the complex cell dynamics (divisions, movement, morphological changes, etc.) underlying embryonic development and adult tissue regeneration requires an efficient means to track cells with high fidelity in space and time. To satisfy this criterion, we developed a transgenic zebrafish line, called PhOTO, that allows photoconvertible optical tracking of nuclear and membrane dynamics in vivo.

Methodology
PhOTO zebrafish ubiquitously express targeted blue fluorescent protein (FP) Cerulean and photoconvertible FP Dendra2 fusions, allowing for instantaneous, precise targeting and tracking of any number of cells using Dendra2 photoconversion while simultaneously monitoring global cell behavior and morphology. Expression persists through adulthood, making the PhOTO zebrafish an excellent tool for studying tissue regeneration: after tail fin amputation and photoconversion of a ∼100µm stripe along the cut area, marked differences seen in how cells contribute to the new tissue give detailed insight into the dynamic process of regeneration. Photoconverted cells that contributed to the regenerate were separated into three distinct populations corresponding to the extent of cell division 7 days after amputation, and a subset of cells that divided the least were organized into an evenly spaced, linear orientation along the length of the newly regenerating fin.

Conclusions/Significance
PhOTO zebrafish have wide applicability for lineage tracing at the systems-level in the early embryo as well as in the adult, making them ideal candidate tools for future research in development, traumatic injury and regeneration, cancer progression, and stem cell behavior.},

We capture images in a single channel at a time over one full occurrence of the motion then repeat acquisition for other channels over subsequent occurrences. We finally build a high-speed multi-channel image sequence by combining the images after applying a normalized mutual information-based time registration procedure., We show that this technique is amenable to image the beating heart of a double-labeled embryonic quail in three channels (brightfield, yellow and mCherry fluorescent proteins) using a fluorescence wide-field microscope equipped with a single monochrome camera and without fast channel switching optics.

	issn = {1090-0535},
	url = {https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3380945/},
	abstract = {Purpose
Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is a common but complex disease with a strong genetic component. Notably, few genes have been robustly associated with POAG. An obvious group of genes to test as susceptibility factors for POAG are the developmental genes forkhead box C1 (FOXC1), transforming growth factor-beta 2 (TGFβ2), and bone morphogenic protein 4 (BMP4). These genes are known to play important roles in the normal morphogenesis of the anterior segment and/or have been implicated in intra-ocular pressure (IOP) regulation and trabecular meshwork function. This study investigates the role of FOXC1, TGFβ2, and BMP4 in POAG.

Methods
The contribution of common genetic variation at the FOXC1, TGFβ2, and BMP4 loci to risk of POAG was investigated in a case-control association study in 330 British Caucasian individuals comprised of 272 high-tension glaucoma (HTG) and 58 ocular hypertension (OHT), and 276 matched controls.

Results
All the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium and genotyping success rate was {\textgreater}92\% for all SNPs. With the exception of a weak association between the BMP4 tagging SNP rs2761884 and the combined patient group HTG+OHT that did not withstand permutation testing (uncorrected p=0.0400, corrected p=0.1320), no associations (p{\textless}0.05) were identified between the patient groups (HTG and OHT) and FOXC1, TGFβ2, and BMP4 alleles and haplotypes compared to the control group.

Conclusions
This is the first association analysis of FOXC1, TGFβ2, and BMP4 and POAG. These genes were selected as candidate genes for POAG because of their biologic roles. No significant associations were identified between FOXC1, TGFβ2, and BMP4 alleles and haplotypes and POAG. The lack of association suggests that common variation in these genes do not have a significant role in the pathogenesis of POAG among British Caucasian subjects.},

The 7S globulins are plant seed storage proteins that have been associated with the development of a number of human diseases, including peanut allergy. Immune reactivity to the wheat seed storage protein globulin-3 (Glo-3) has been associated with the development of the autoimmune disease type 1 diabetes in diabetes-prone rats and mice, as well as in a subset of human patients.

Findings
The present study characterized native wheat Glo-3 in salt-soluble wheat seed protein extracts. Glo-3-like peptides were observed primarily in the wheat embryo. Glo-3-like proteins varied significantly in their molecular masses and isoelectric points, as determined by two dimensional electrophoresis and immunoblotting with anti-Glo-3A antibodies. Five major polypeptide spots were identified by mass spectrometry and N-terminal sequencing as belonging to the Glo-3 family.

Conclusions
These results in combination with our previous findings have allowed for the development of a hypothetical model of the post-translational events contributing to the wheat 7S globulin profile in mature wheat kernels.},

However, using traditional retroviral methods to generate transgenic avian research models has proven problematic. As a result, experiments aimed at genetic manipulations on birds remained difficult for this popular research tool. Recently, lentiviral methods have enabled production of transgenic birds, including a transgenic Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica) line showing neuronal-specificity and stable expression of eGFP across generations (termed here as GFP quail). To test whether the GFP quail may serve as a viable alternative to the popular chicken model system, with the additional benefit of gene manipulation, we compared the development, organization, structure and function of a specific neuronal circuit in chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) to that of the GFP quail. This study focuses on a well-defined avian brain region, the principal nuclei of the sound localization circuit in the auditory brainstem, nucleus magnocellularis (NM) and nucleus laminaris (NL). Our results demonstrate that structural and functional properties of NM and NL neurons in the GFP quail, as well as their dynamic properties in response to changes in the environment, are nearly identical to those in chickens. These similarities demonstrate that the GFP quail, as well as other transgenic quail lines, can serve as an attractive avian model system, with the advantage of being able to build on the wealth of information already available from the chicken.},

Sequential deletions of three of these enhancers identified small sequence elements sufficient to drive expression in zebrafish trigeminal and Rohon-Beard (RB) neurons. One of these reporters, using the Fru.p2x3-2 enhancer, highlighted a somatosensory neuron subtype that expressed both the p2rx3a and pkcα genes. Comparison with a previously described trpA1b reporter revealed that it highlighted the same neurons as the Fru.p2x3-2 reporter. To determine whether neurons of this subtype possess characteristic peripheral branching morphologies or central axon projection patterns, we analyzed the morphology of single neurons. Surprisingly, although these analyses revealed diversity in peripheral axon branching and central axon projection, PKCα/p2rx3a/trpA1b-expressing RB cells did not possess obvious characteristic morphological features, suggesting that even within this molecularly defined subtype, individual neurons may possess distinct properties.

	abstract = {Mammals rely on their acute olfactory sense for their survival. The most anterior olfactory subsystem in the nose, the Grueneberg ganglion (GG), plays a role in detecting alarm pheromone, cold, and urinary compounds. GG neurons respond homogeneously to these stimuli with increases in intracellular [Ca2+] or transcription of immediate-early genes. In this electrophysiological study, we used patch-clamp techniques to characterize the membrane properties of GG neurons. Our results offer evidence of functional heterogeneity in the GG. GG neurons fire spontaneously and independently in several stable patterns, including phasic and repetitive single-spike modes of discharge. Whole cell recordings demonstrated two distinct voltage-gated fast-inactivating Na+ currents with different steady-state voltage dependencies and different sensitivities to tetrodotoxin. Hodgkin-Huxley simulations showed that these Na+ currents confer dual mechanisms of action potential generation and contribute to different firing patterns. Additionally, GG neurons exhibited hyperpolarization-activated inward currents that modulated spontaneous firing in vitro. Thus, in GG neurons, the heterogeneity of firing patterns is linked to the unusual repertoire of ionic currents. The membrane properties described here will aid the interpretation of chemosensory function in the GG.},

In this study, examination of Cos7 cells transfected with SCARB2 cDNA derived from two patients with AMRF syndrome showed that the resultant protein was truncated and was not incorporated into vesicular structures, as occurred with full-length SCARB2 cDNA. Mutant SCARB2 protein failed to colocalize with lysosomes and was found in the endoplasmic reticulum or the cytosol indicating a loss of function. Cultured skin fibroblast and Epstein–Barr virus–transformed lymphoblastoid B cell lines (LCLs) were created from these two patients. Despite the loss of SCARB2 function, studies with lysosomal-associated membrane protein (LAMP) 1 and LAMP2 demonstrated normal lysosomal numbers in fibroblasts and LCLs. Immunofluorescence microscopy using anti-LAMP1 and anti-LAMP2 antibodies also showed normal lysosomal structures in fibroblasts. There was no change in the morphology of fibroblasts examined by electron microscopy compared with cells from unaffected individuals. By contrast, LCLs from individuals bearing SCARB2 mutations had large intracellular vesicles that resembled autophagosomes and contained heterogeneous cellular debris. Some of the autophagosomes were seen to be extruding cellular contents into the media. Furthermore, LCLs had elevated levels of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3-II, consistent with increased autophagy. These data demonstrate that SCARB2 mutations are associated with an inability to process autophagosomes in B lymphocytes, suggesting a novel function for SCARB2 in immune function.},

	abstract = {Background
Infant dietary exposures have been linked to type 1 diabetes (T1D) development. IgG4 antibody responses to food antigens are associated with food intolerances but have not been explored prospectively in the period preceding T1D.

Methods
Using a case-cohort design, IgG4 antibodies to ß-lactoglobulin, gluten, and ovalbumin were measured in plasma collected annually from 260 DAISY participants. Of those, 77 developed islet autoimmunity (IA), defined as positive for either insulin, GAD65 or IA-2 autoantibodies on two consecutive visits, and 22 developed T1D.

Results
In mixed model analysis adjusting for HLA-DR status, T1D family history, age and ethnicity, higher ß-lactoglobulin IgG4 concentrations were associated with shorter breastfeeding duration (beta = −0.03, 95\% Confidence Interval: −0.05, −0.006) and earlier first cow’s milk exposure (beta = −0.04, 95\% Confidence Interval: −0.08, 0.00). Higher gluten IgG4 was associated with older age at gluten introduction (beta = 0.06, 95\% Confidence Interval: 0.00, 0.13). In proportional hazards analysis adjusting for HLA-DR status, T1D family history and ethnicity, IgG4 against individual or multiple dietary antigens throughout childhood were not associated with IA. In addition, mean antigen-specific IgG4 concentrations in infancy (age {\textless}2 years) were not associated with risk of IA nor progression to T1D. Higher ovalbumin IgG4 at first IA positive visit was marginally associated with progression to T1D (Hazard Ratio: 1.39, 95\% Confidence Interval: 1.00, 1.92).

Conclusion
We found no association between the IgG4 response to β-lactoglobulin, gluten, and the development of either IA or T1D. The association between higher ovalbumin and progression to T1D in children with IA should be explored in other populations.},

Diabetes-prone BioBreeding (BBdp) rats were housed in specific pathogen-free (SPF) or germ-free (GF) conditions and weaned onto diabetes-promoting cereal diets or a protective low-antigen hydrolyzed casein (HC) diet, and T1D incidence was monitored. Fecal microbiota 16S rRNA genes, immune cell distribution, and gene expression in the jejunum were analyzed. T1D was highest in cereal-SPF (65\%) and cereal-GF rats (53\%) but inhibited and delayed in HC-fed counterparts. Nearly all HC-GF rats remained diabetes-free, whereas HC-fed SPF rats were less protected (7 vs. 29\%). Bacterial communities differed in SPF rats fed cereal compared with HC. Cereal-SPF rats displayed increased gut CD3+ and CD8α+ lymphocytes, ratio of Ifng to Il4 mRNA, and Lck expression, indicating T-cell activation. The ratio of CD3+ T cells expressing the Treg marker Foxp3+ was highest in HC-GF and lowest in cereal-SPF rats. Resident CD163+ M2 macrophages were increased in HC-protected rats. The cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide (Camp) gene was upregulated in the jejunum of HC diet–protected rats, and CAMP+ cells colocalized with CD163. A cereal diet was a stronger promoter of T1D than gut microbes in association with impaired gut immune homeostasis.},

	abstract = {Neuroscience is at a crossroads. Great effort is being invested into deciphering specific neural interactions and circuits. At the same time, there exist few general theories or principles that explain brain function. We attribute this disparity, in part, to limitations in current methodologies. Traditional neurophysiological approaches record the activities of one neuron or a few neurons at a time. Neurochemical approaches focus on single neurotransmitters. Yet, there is an increasing realization that neural circuits operate at emergent levels, where the interactions between hundreds or thousands of neurons, utilizing multiple chemical transmitters, generate functional states. Brains function at the nanoscale, so tools to study brains must ultimately operate at this scale, as well. Nanoscience and nanotechnology are poised to provide a rich toolkit of novel methods to explore brain function by enabling simultaneous measurement and manipulation of activity of thousands or even millions of neurons. We and others refer to this goal as the Brain Activity Mapping Project. In this Nano Focus, we discuss how recent developments in nanoscale analysis tools and in the design and synthesis of nanomaterials have generated optical, electrical, and chemical methods that can readily be adapted for use in neuroscience. These approaches represent exciting areas of technical development and research. Moreover, unique opportunities exist for nanoscientists, nanotechnologists, and other physical scientists and engineers to contribute to tackling the challenging problems involved in understanding the fundamentals of brain function.},

	abstract = {Salt reabsorption is the major energy-requiring process in the kidney, and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an important regulator of cellular metabolism. Mice with targeted deletion of the β1-subunit of AMPK (AMPK-β1−/− mice) had significantly increased urinary Na+ excretion on a normal salt diet. This was associated with reduced expression of the β-subunit of the epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) and increased subapical tubular expression of kidney-specific Na+-K+-2Cl− cotransporter 2 (NKCC2) in the medullary thick ascending limb of Henle. AMPK-β1−/− mice fed a salt-deficient diet were able to conserve Na+, but renin secretion increased 180\% compared with control mice. Cyclooxygenase-2 mRNA also increased in the kidney cortex, indicating greater signaling through the macula densa tubular salt-sensing pathway. To determine whether the increase in renin secretion was due to a change in regulation of fatty acid metabolism by AMPK, mice with a mutation of the inhibitory AMPK phosphosite in acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 [ACC1-knockin (KI)S79A mice] were examined. ACC1-KIS79A mice on a normal salt diet had no increase in salt loss or renin secretion, and expression of NKCC2, Na+-Cl− cotransporter, and ENaC-β were similar to those in control mice. When mice were placed on a salt-deficient diet, however, renin secretion and cortical expression of cyclooxygenase-2 mRNA increased significantly in ACC1-KIS79A mice compared with control mice. In summary, our data suggest that renin synthesis and secretion are regulated by AMPK and coupled to metabolism by phosphorylation of ACC1.},

	abstract = {Detailed visualization of microvascular changes in the human retina is clinically limited by the capabilities of angiography imaging, a 2D fundus photograph that requires an intravenous injection of fluorescent dye. Whereas current angiography methods enable visualization of some retinal capillary detail, they do not adequately reveal the choriocapillaris or other microvascular features beneath the retina. We have developed a noninvasive microvascular imaging technique called phase-variance optical coherence tomography (pvOCT), which identifies vasculature three dimensionally through analysis of data acquired with OCT systems. The pvOCT imaging method is not only capable of generating capillary perfusion maps for the retina, but it can also use the 3D capabilities to segment the data in depth to isolate vasculature in different layers of the retina and choroid. This paper demonstrates some of the capabilities of pvOCT imaging of the anterior layers of choroidal vasculature of a healthy normal eye as well as of eyes with geographic atrophy (GA) secondary to age-related macular degeneration. The pvOCT data presented permit digital segmentation to produce 2D depth-resolved images of the retinal vasculature, the choriocapillaris, and the vessels in Sattler’s and Haller’s layers. Comparisons are presented between en face projections of pvOCT data within the superficial choroid and clinical angiography images for regions of GA. Abnormalities and vascular dropout observed within the choriocapillaris for pvOCT are compared with regional GA progression. The capability of pvOCT imaging of the microvasculature of the choriocapillaris and the anterior choroidal vasculature has the potential to become a unique tool to evaluate therapies and understand the underlying mechanisms of age-related macular degeneration progression.},

Otolith number, size and placement are under strict developmental control, but the mechanisms that ensure otolith assembly atop specific cells of the sensory epithelium are unclear. Here we demonstrate that cilia motility is required for normal otolith assembly and localization. Using in vivo video microscopy, we show that motile tether cilia at opposite poles of the otic vesicle create fluid vortices that attract otolith precursor particles, thereby biasing an otherwise random distribution to direct localized otolith seeding on tether cilia. Independent knockdown of subunits for the dynein regulatory complex and outer-arm dynein disrupt cilia motility, leading to defective otolith biogenesis. These results demonstrate a requirement for the dynein regulatory complex in vertebrates and show that cilia-driven flow is a key epigenetic factor in controlling otolith biomineralization.},

Regulation of VGSCs occurs at a hierarchy of levels from transcription to post-translation. Importantly, mainstream cancer mechanisms, especially hormones and growth factors, play a significant role in the regulation. On the whole, in major hormone-sensitive cancers, such as breast and prostate cancer, there is a negative association between genomic steroid hormone sensitivity and functional VGSC expression. Activity-dependent regulation by positive feedback has been demonstrated in strongly metastatic cells whereby the VGSC is self-sustaining, with its activity promoting further functional channel expression. Such auto-regulation is unlike normal cells in which activity-dependent regulation occurs mostly via negative feedback. Throughout, we highlight the possible clinical implications of functional VGSC expression and regulation in cancer.},

IgG Fc binds gE-gI at basic, but not acidic, pH, suggesting that IgG bound at extracellular pH by cell surface gE-gI would dissociate and be degraded in acidic endosomes/lysosomes if endocytosed. The fate of viral antigens associated with gE-gI–bound IgG had been unknown: they could remain at the cell surface or be endocytosed with IgG. Here, we developed an in vitro model system for ABB and investigated the trafficking of ABB complexes using 4-D confocal fluorescence imaging of ABB complexes with transferrin or epidermal growth factor, well-characterized intracellular trafficking markers. Our data showed that cells expressing gE-gI and the viral antigen HSV-1 gD endocytosed anti-gD IgG and gD in a gE-gI–dependent process, resulting in lysosomal localization. These results suggest that gE-gI can mediate clearance of infected cell surfaces of anti-viral host IgG and viral antigens to evade IgG-mediated responses, representing a general mechanism for viral Fc receptors in immune evasion and viral pathogenesis., Herpes Simplex Virus 1 (HSV-1) infects 40–80\% of adults worldwide. HSV-1 initiates infection at mucosal surfaces and spreads along sensory neurons to establish a life-long latent infection that can lead to neurological diseases. Humans usually develop IgG antibodies that specifically recognize pathogens via fragment antigen binding (Fab) variable regions. HSV-1 can avoid the protective effects of antibodies by producing gE-gI, a receptor that binds to the constant portion of IgGs (Fc), thereby tethering the antibody in a position where it cannot trigger downstream immune functions. A gE-gI–bound IgG can participate in antibody bipolar bridging (ABB) such that the Fabs bind a viral antigen and the Fc binds gE-gI. The fate of ABB complexes had been unknown. We used live cell fluorescent imaging to follow ABB complexes during their formation and transport within a cell. We demonstrated that ABB assemblies were internalized into acidic intracellular compartments, where gE-gI dissociated from IgG–viral antigen complexes and the IgG and antigen were targeted for degradation within lysosomes. These results suggest that gE-gI mediates clearance of infected cell surfaces of both anti-viral IgGs and viral antigens, a general mechanism to facilitate latent infection by evading IgG-mediated responses.},

To study gap junctions’ role in fast motor behavior, we used a minimally-invasive neural-tract-tracing technique to introduce gap junction-permeant or -impermeant dyes into deep muscles controlling the gonopodium of the adult male Mosquitofish, a teleost fish that rapidly transfers (complete in {\textless}20 mS) spermatozeugmata into the female reproductive tract. Dye-coupling in the 14th spinal segment controlling the gonopodium reveals coupling between motor neurons and a commissural primary ascending interneuron (CoPA IN) and shows that the 14th segment has an extensive and elaborate dendritic arbor and more gap junctions than do other segments. Whole-mount immunohistochemistry for Cx35 results confirm dye-coupling and show it occurs via gap junctions. Finally, FRIL shows that gap junctions are at mixed synapses and reveals that {\textgreater}50 of the 62 gap junctions at mixed synapses are in the 14th spinal segment. Our results support and extend studies showing gap junctions at mixed synapses in spinal cord segments involved in control of genital reflexes in rodents, and they suggest a link between mixed synapses and fast motor behavior. The findings provide a basis for studies of specific roles of spinal neurons in the generation/regulation of sex-specific behavior and for studies of gap junctions’ role in regulating fast motor behavior. Finally, the CoPA IN provides a novel candidate neuron for future studies of gap junctions and neural control of fast motor behaviors.},

	abstract = {Riboswitches are conserved regions within mRNA molecules that bind specific metabolites and regulate gene expression. TPP-riboswitches, which respond to thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), are involved in the regulation of thiamine metabolism in numerous bacteria. As these regulatory RNAs are often modulating essential biosynthesis pathways they have become increasingly interesting as promising antibacterial targets. Here, we describe thiamine analogs containing a central 1,2,3-triazole group to induce repression of thiM-riboswitch dependent gene expression in different E. coli strains. Additionally, we show that compound activation is dependent on proteins involved in the metabolic pathways of thiamine uptake and synthesis. The most promising molecule, triazolethiamine (TT), shows concentration dependent reporter gene repression that is dependent on the presence of thiamine kinase ThiK, whereas the effect of pyrithiamine (PT), a known TPP-riboswitch modulator, is ThiK independent. We further show that this dependence can be bypassed by triazolethiamine-derivatives that bear phosphate-mimicking moieties. As triazolethiamine reveals superior activity compared to pyrithiamine, it represents a very promising starting point for developing novel antibacterial compounds that target TPP-riboswitches. Riboswitch-targeting compounds engage diverse endogenous mechanisms to attain in vivo activity. These findings are of importance for the understanding of compounds that require metabolic activation to achieve effective riboswitch modulation and they enable the design of novel compound generations that are independent of endogenous activation mechanisms.},

In the present study, we retrospectively analyzed clinical data, plasma samples and post-mortem tissue specimens derived from a risk assessment study in bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE)-infected female cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis). The original study design aimed to determine minimal infectious doses after oral or intracerebral (i.c.) infection of macaques to assess the risk for humans. High-dose exposures resulted in 100\% attack rates and a median incubation time of 4.7 years as described previously. Retrospective analyses of clinical data from high-dosed macaques revealed that foodborne BSE transmission caused rapid weight gain within 1.5 years post infection (β = 0.915; P{\textless}0.0001) which was not seen in age- and sex-matched control animals or i.c. infected animals. The rapid-onset obesity was not associated with impaired pancreatic islet function or glucose metabolism. In the early preclinical phase of oral transmission associated with body weight gain, prion accumulation was confined to the gastrointestinal tract. Intriguingly, immunohistochemical findings suggest that foodborne BSE transmission has a pathophysiological impact on gut endocrine cells which may explain rapid weight gain. To our knowledge, this is the first experimental model which clearly demonstrates that foodborne pathogens can induce obesity.},

	abstract = {Background
Reporting of adverse clinical events is thought to be an effective method of improving the safety of healthcare. Underreporting of these adverse events is often said to occur with consequence of missing of opportunities to learn from these incidents. A clinical incident can be defined as any occurrence which is not consistent with the routine care of the patient or the routine operation of the institution.

Objectives
To assess the effects of interventions designed to increase clinical incident reporting in healthcare settings.

Search methods
We searched the the following databases: Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (OVID), EMBASE (OVID), CINAHL (EBSCO), Social Science Citation Index and Science Citation Index (Web of Knowledge), Healthstar (OVID), INSPEC, DHSS-DATA, SIGLE, ISI Conference Proceedings, Web of Science Conference Proceedings Citation Index (Science), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE).

Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCT), controlled before-after studies (CBA) and interrupted time series (ITS) of interventions designed to increase clinical incident reporting in healthcare.

Data collection and analysis
At least two review authors assessed the eligibility of potentially relevant studies, extracted the data and assessed the quality of included studies.

Main results
Four studies (one CBA and three ITS studies) met our inclusion criteria and were included in the review. The CBA study showed a significant improvement in incident reporting rates after the introduction of the new reporting system. Just one of the ITS studies showed a statistically significant improved effectiveness of the new reporting system from nine months. The other two studies reported no statistically significant improvements.

Authors’ conclusions
Because of the limitations of the studies it is not possible to draw conclusions for clinical practice. Anyone introducing a system into practice should give careful consideration to conducting an evaluation using a robust design.},

	abstract = {Purpose
Phase-contrast optical coherence tomography (PC-OCT) provides volumetric imaging of the retinal vasculature without the need for intravenous injection of a fluorophore. Here, we compare images from PC-OCT and fluorescein angiography (FA) for normal individuals and patients with age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy.

Design
This is an evaluation of a diagnostic technology.

Participants
4 patients underwent comparative retinovascular imaging using FA and PC-OCT. Imaging was performed on 1 normal individual, 1 patient with dry age-related macular degeneration, 1 patient with exudative age-related macular degeneration and 1 patient with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy.

Methods
FA imaging was performed using a Topcon (TRC-50IX) camera having resolution of 1280 (H) x 1024 (V) pixels. PC-OCT images were generated by software data processing of the entire cross-sectional image from consecutively acquired B-scans. Bulk axial motion was calculated and corrected for each transverse location, reducing the phase noise introduced from eye motion. Phase contrast was calculated through the variance of the motion-corrected phase changes acquired within multiple B-scans at the same position. Repeating these calculations over the entire volumetric scan produced a three-dimensional PC-OCT representation of the vasculature.

Main Outcome Measures
Feasibility of rendering retinal and choroidal microvasculature using PC-OCT was compared qualitatively to FA, the current gold standard for retinovascular imaging.

Results
PC-OCT rendered a two-dimensional depth color-coded vasculature map of the retinal and choroidal vasculature non-invasively. The choriocapillaris was imaged with better resolution of microvascular detail using PC-OCT. Areas of geographic atrophy and choroidal neovascularization imaged by FA were depicted by PC-OCT. Regions of capillary non-perfusion from diabetic retinopathy were shown by both imaging techniques; there was not complete correspondence between microaneurysms shown on FA and PC-OCT images.

Conclusion
PC-OCT yields high resolution imaging of the retinal and choroidal microvasculature that compares favorably to FA.},

	abstract = {Background
Parasympathetic signaling has been inferred to regulate epithelial branching as well as organ regeneration and tumor development. However, the relative contribution of local nerve contact versus secreted signals remains unclear. Here, we show a conserved (vertebrates to invertebrates) requirement for intact local nerves in airway branching, persisting even when cholinergic neurotransmission is blocked.

Results
In the vertebrate lung, deleting enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP)-labeled intrinsic neurons using a two-photon laser leaves adjacent cells intact, but abolishes branching. Branching is unaffected by similar laser power delivered to the immediately adjacent non-neural mesodermal tissue, by blocking cholinergic receptors or by blocking synaptic transmission with botulinum toxin A. Because adjacent vasculature and epithelial proliferation also contribute to branching in the vertebrate lung, the direct dependence on nerves for airway branching was tested by deleting neurons in Drosophila embryos. A specific deletion of neurons in the Drosophila embryo by driving cell-autonomous RicinA under the pan-neuronal elav enhancer perturbed Drosophila airway development. This system confirmed that even in the absence of a vasculature or epithelial proliferation, airway branching is still disrupted by neural lesioning.

Conclusions
Together, this shows that airway morphogenesis requires local innervation in vertebrates and invertebrates, yet neurotransmission is dispensable. The need for innervation persists in the fly, wherein adjacent vasculature and epithelial proliferation are absent. Our novel, targeted laser ablation technique permitted the local function of parasympathetic innervation to be distinguished from neurotransmission.

Much has been learned about the genetic mechanisms underlying the development of the cardiovascular system, but we are just beginning to understand how changes in heart and vessel structure are influenced by hemodynamic forces such as shear stress. Recent work has shown that vessel remodeling in the mouse yolk sac is secondarily effected when cardiac function is reduced or absent. These findings indicate that proper circulation is required for vessel remodeling, but have not defined whether the role of circulation is to provide mechanical cues, to deliver oxygen or to circulate signaling molecules. Here, we used time-lapse confocal microscopy to determine the role of fluid-derived forces in vessel remodeling in the developing murine yolk sac. Novel methods were used to characterize flows in normal embryos and in embryos with impaired contractility (Mlc2a−/−). We found abnormal plasma and erythroblast circulation in these embryos, which led us to hypothesize that the entry of erythroblasts into circulation is a key event in triggering vessel remodeling. We tested this by sequestering erythroblasts in the blood islands, thereby lowering the hematocrit and reducing shear stress, and found that vessel remodeling and the expression of eNOS (Nos3) depends on erythroblast flow. Further, we rescued remodeling defects and eNOS expression in low-hematocrit embryos by restoring the viscosity of the blood. These data show that hemodynamic force is necessary and sufficient to induce vessel remodeling in the mammalian yolk sac.},

The stereotyped cross-midline mitoses of progenitors in the zebrafish neural keel [–] provide a unique experimental paradigm for defining the role and control of single cell orientation for tissue-level morphogenesis in vivo., We show that the coordinated orientation of individual progenitor cell division in the neural keel is the cellular determinant required for morphogenesis into a neural tube epithelium with a single straight lumen. We find that Scribble is required for oriented cell division and that its function in this process is independent of canonical apico-basal and planar polarity pathways. We identify a role for Scribble in controlling clustering of α-Catenin foci in dividing progenitors. Loss of either Scrib or of N-cadherin results in abnormally oriented mitoses, reduced cross-midline cell divisions and similar neural tube defects. We propose that Scribble-dependent nascent cell-cell adhesion clusters between neuroepithelial progenitors contribute to define orientation of their cell division. Finally, our data demonstrate that while oriented mitoses of individual cells determine neural tube architecture, the tissue can in turn feed back on its constituent cells to define their polarization and cell division orientation to ensure robust tissue morphogenesis.},

These olfactory subsystems use different neuronal signal transduction pathways, receptor expression repertoires, and axonal projection targets. The Grueneberg Ganglion (GG) is a newly-appreciated olfactory subsystem with receptor neurons located just inside of the nostrils that project axons to a unique domain of interconnected glomeruli in the caudal olfactory bulb. It is not well-understood how the GG relates to other olfactory subsystems in contributing to the olfactory sense. Furthermore, the range of chemoreceptors and the signal transduction cascade utilized by the GG have remained mysterious. To resolve these unknowns, we explored the molecular relationship between the GG and the GC-D neurons, another olfactory subsystem that innervates similarly-interconnected glomeruli in the same bulbar region. We found that mouse GG neurons express the cGMP-associated signaling proteins phosphodiesterase 2a, cGMP-dependent kinase II, and cyclic nucleotide gated channel subunit A3 coupled to a chemoreceptor repertoire of cilia-localized particulate guanylyl cyclases (pGC-G and pGC-A). The primary cGMP signaling pathway of the GG is shared with the GC-D neurons, unifying their target glomeruli as a unique center of olfactory cGMP signal transduction. However, the distinct chemoreceptor repertoire in the GG suggests that the GG is an independent olfactory subsystem. This subsystem is well-suited to detect a unique set of odors and to mediate behaviors that remained intact in previous olfactory perturbations.},

Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is the number 1 genetic killer of young children. It is caused by mutation or deletion of the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene. Although SMA is primarily a motor neuron disease, metabolism abnormalities such as metabolic acidosis, abnormal fatty acid metabolism, hyperlipidemia, and hyperglycemia have been reported in SMA patients. We thus initiated an in-depth analysis of glucose metabolism in SMA.

Methods
Glucose metabolism and pancreas development were investigated in the Smn2B/− intermediate SMA mouse model and type I SMA patients.

Results
Here, we demonstrate in an SMA mouse model a dramatic cell fate imbalance within pancreatic islets, with a predominance of glucagon-producing α cells at the expense of insulin-producing β cells. These SMA mice display fasting hyperglycemia, hyperglucagonemia, and glucose resistance. We demonstrate similar abnormalities in pancreatic islets from deceased children with the severe infantile form of SMA in association with supportive evidence of glucose intolerance in at least a subset of such children.

Interpretation
Our results indicate that defects in glucose metabolism may play an important contributory role in SMA pathogenesis.},

	abstract = {The gut immune system and its modification by diet have been implicated in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes (T1D). Therefore, we investigated gut immune status in non-diabetes-prone LEW.1AR1 and diabetes-prone LEW.1AR1-iddm rats and evaluated the effect of a low antigen, hydrolysed casein (HC)-based diet on gut immunity and T1D. Rats were weaned onto a cereal-based or HC-based diet and monitored for T1D. Strain and dietary effects on immune homeostasis were assessed in non-diabetic rats (50–60 days old) and rats with recent-onset diabetes using flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. Immune gene expression was analysed in mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) and jejunum using quantitative RT-PCR and PCR arrays. T1D was prevented in LEW.1AR1-iddm rats by feeding an HC diet. Diabetic LEW.1AR1-iddm rats had fewer lymphoid tissue T cells compared with LEW.1AR1 rats. The percentage of CD4+ Foxp3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells was decreased in pancreatic lymph nodes (PLN) of diabetic rats. The jejunum of 50-day LEW.1AR1-iddm rats contained fewer CD3+ T cells, CD163+ M2 macrophages and Foxp3+ Treg cells. Ifng expression was increased in MLN and Foxp3 expression was decreased in the jejunum of LEW.1AR1-iddm rats; Ifng/Il4 was decreased in jejunum of LEW.1AR1-iddm rats fed HC. PCR arrays revealed decreased expression of M2-associated macrophage factors in 50-day LEW.1AR1-iddm rats. Wheat peptides stimulated T-cell proliferation and activation in MLN and PLN cells from diabetic LEW.1AR1-iddm rats. LEW.1AR1-iddm rats displayed gut immune cell deficits and decreased immunoregulatory capacity, which were partially corrected in animals fed a low antigen, protective HC diet consistent with other models of T1D.},

	abstract = {Purpose
To demonstrate the use of phase-variance optical coherence tomography (PV-OCT) angiography for detection of pigment epithelial detachment (PED) vascularization in age-related macular degeneration (AMD).

Patients and methods
Patients with PEDs and exudative AMD were evaluated by the Retina Services at the University of California, Davis, and the University of California, San Francisco. Each subject underwent fluorescein angiography and structural optical coherence tomography (OCT). Phase-variance OCT analysis was used to create angiographic images of the retinal and choroidal vasculature. PV-OCT-generated B-scans were superimposed on structural OCT B-scans to allow easy identification of perfused vascular structures.

Results
Three patients with vascularized PEDs were imaged with PV-OCT, and each was found to have a vascular signal extending from the choroid into the hyperreflective substance of the PED. Two patients who had no evidence of PED vascularization on fluorescein angiography did not have vascular signals within their PEDs on PV-OCT.

Conclusion
Structural OCT and PV-OCT images can be combined to create composite B-scans that offer high-resolution views of the retinal tissue along with dynamic vascular visualization. This technique offers a fast, noninvasive method for detecting vascularization of PEDs in AMD and may aid in the early detection of neovascular disease.},

	abstract = {Objectives
To assess the feasibility and acceptability of facilitated advance care planning (ACP) discussions in elderly Italian and Greek-speaking inpatients compared to English-speaking inpatients.

Design, setting and participants
This cross-sectional study with convenience sampling was conducted in Melbourne, Australia, and recruited hospital inpatients with medical decision-making capacity, aged 65 years or above, who spoke Greek (25 patients), Italian (24 patients) or English (63 patients).

Intervention
Facilitated ACP was offered, aiming to assists patients to consider and discuss their goals, values, beliefs and future treatment wishes with their family and doctor; to help them consider how they would like healthcare decisions made in the future if they become unable to do this for themselves; and to complete advance care directives.

Main outcome measures
The completion of ACP discussions, their duration, advance care directive completion and utilisation of interpreters.

Results
Of 112 patients, 109 (97\%) had at least one discussion, 63 (54\%) completed advance care directives, either nominating a substitute decision-maker, documenting their wishes or both, and 76 (68\%) included family in discussions. The median duration of discussions for all patients was slightly more than 1 h, over two visits. There were no differences between the Greek-speaking and the Italian-speaking patients, or between the Non-English speaking and the English-speaking patients in any of these measures. Only 14 non-English speaking patients, (30\%) utilised interpreters, but when utilised, patients were much more likely (p{\textless}0.005) to complete advance care directives.

Conclusions
Facilitated ACP in elderly Italian and Greek-speaking patients is feasible, acceptable and is similar to that for English-speaking patients.},

In teleostei, otolith development is critically dependant on flow forces generated by beating cilia; however, the mechanism by which flow controls otolith formation remains unclear. Here, we have developed a non-invasive flow probe using optical tweezers and a viscous flow model in order to demonstrate how the observed hydrodynamics influence otolith assembly. We show that rotational flow stirs and suppresses precursor agglomeration in the core of the cilia-driven vortex. The velocity field correlates with the shape of the otolith and we provide evidence that hydrodynamics is actively involved in controlling otolith morphogenesis. An implication of this hydrodynamic effect is that otolith self-assembly is mediated by the balance between Brownian motion and cilia-driven flow. More generally, this flow feature highlights an alternative biological strategy for controlling particle localization in solution.},

	abstract = {This work, for the first time to our knowledge, distinctly visualizes the two different populations of dendritic cells (DCs) essential for cytotoxic T-cell generation in the skin-draining lymph nodes (SDLNs): the migratory CD103hi DCs that immigrate from other organs including the skin and the CD8αhi DCs that are resident in the SDLNs. By imaging the spatiotemporal dynamics of the migratory and resident subsets of DCs in the SDLNs, we find that these two different populations play different roles in antigen presentation, with the migratory DCs being dramatically more potent in interacting with CD8+ T cells. This work offers critical insights into several areas, including optimizing vaccines for microbes and tumors., Dendritic cells (DCs) are antigen-presenting cells specialized for activating T cells to elicit effector T-cell functions. Cross-presenting DCs are a DC subset capable of presenting antigens to CD8+ T cells and play critical roles in cytotoxic T-cell–mediated immune responses to microorganisms and cancer. Although their importance is known, the spatiotemporal dynamics of cross-presenting DCs in vivo are incompletely understood. Here, we study the T-cell zone in skin-draining lymph nodes (SDLNs) and find it is compartmentalized into regions for CD8+ T-cell activation by cross-presenting DCs that express the chemokine (C motif) receptor 1 gene, Xcr1 and for CD4+ T-cell activation by CD11b+ DCs. Xcr1-expressing DCs in the SDLNs are composed of two different populations: migratory (CD103hi) DCs, which immigrate from the skin, and resident (CD8αhi) DCs, which develop in the nodes. To characterize the dynamic interactions of these distinct DC populations with CD8+ T cells during their activation in vivo, we developed a photoconvertible reporter mouse strain, which permits us to distinctively visualize the migratory and resident subsets of Xcr1-expressing DCs. After leaving the skin, migratory DCs infiltrated to the deep T-cell zone of the SDLNs over 3 d, which corresponded to their half-life in the SDLNs. Intravital two-photon imaging showed that after soluble antigen immunization, the newly arriving migratory DCs more efficiently form sustained conjugates with antigen-specific CD8+ T cells than other Xcr1-expressing DCs in the SDLNs. These results offer in vivo evidence for differential contributions of migratory and resident cross-presenting DCs to CD8+ T-cell activation.},

In response to ligand binding AR translocates to the nucleus, though the molecular mechanism is not well understood. We therefore developed multimodal Image Correlation Spectroscopy (mICS) to measure anisotropic molecular motion across a live cell. We applied mICS to AR translocation dynamics to reveal its multimodal motion. By integrating fluorescence imaging methods we observed evidence for diffusion, confined movement, and binding of AR within both the cytoplasm and nucleus of PCa cells. Our findings suggest that in presence of cytoplasmic diffusion, the probability of AR crossing the nuclear membrane is an important factor in determining the AR distribution between cytoplasm and the nucleus, independent of functional microtubule transport. These findings may have implications for the future design of novel therapeutics targeting the AR pathway in PCa.},

Infusion of l‐[ring‐13C6] phenylalanine was used to measure basal myofibrillar MPS at rest (REST), in a nonexercised leg following protein ingestion (FED) and following RE and protein ingestion (FEDEX). MPS was significantly elevated above REST during FEDEX in both the FO and CO groups, but there was no effect of supplementation.

	abstract = {Elucidating the causes of congenital heart defects is made difficult by the complex morphogenesis of the mammalian heart, which takes place early in development, involves contributions from multiple germ layers, and is controlled by many genes. Here, we use a conditional/invertible genetic strategy to identify the cell lineage(s) responsible for the development of heart defects in a Nipbl-deficient mouse model of Cornelia de Lange Syndrome, in which global yet subtle transcriptional dysregulation leads to development of atrial septal defects (ASDs) at high frequency. Using an approach that allows for recombinase-mediated creation or rescue of Nipbl deficiency in different lineages, we uncover complex interactions between the cardiac mesoderm, endoderm, and the rest of the embryo, whereby the risk conferred by genetic abnormality in any one lineage is modified, in a surprisingly non-additive way, by the status of others. We argue that these results are best understood in the context of a model in which the risk of heart defects is associated with the adequacy of early progenitor cell populations relative to the sizes of the structures they must eventually form., Congenital heart defects, the most common birth defect, are thought mainly to arise through interactions among multiple genes. We studied atrial septal defects (a common type of heart defect) in a mouse model of Cornelia de Lange Syndrome, in which loss of one copy of the Nipbl gene produces frequent developmental abnormalities. By causing subtle dysregulation of the expression of many hundreds of genes, Nipbl haploinsufficiency serves as a model for the polygenic origins of common birth defects. We used an improved genetic technology to separately create or rescue deficiency for Nipbl within the major cardiogenic tissue lineages (lineages that contribute to or control the morphogenesis of the developing heart). Unexpectedly, we found that risk for developing atrial septal defects could not be mapped to any single one of these cardiogenic lineages, but rather was determined by non-additive interactions between these lineages and the rest of the body. Intriguingly, being Nipbl-deficient in the rest of the body reduced the risk conferred by being Nipbl-deficient in either of two distinct cardiogenic lineages. We hypothesize that this effect is driven by developmental coupling between body size and heart size, with defects arising when progenitor cells cannot be provided fast enough to meet the requirements imposed on the heart by other growing tissues. To our knowledge, this is the first genetic demonstration that major risk factors for heart defects are likely to lie outside of the heart itself.},

Multiplexed experiments, in which multiple target mRNAs are mapped in a single sample, are essential for studying regulatory interactions, but remain cumbersome in most model organisms. Programmable in situ amplifiers based on the mechanism of hybridization chain reaction (HCR) overcome this longstanding challenge by operating independently within a sample, enabling multiplexed experiments to be performed with an experimental timeline independent of the number of target mRNAs. To assist biologists working across a broad spectrum of organisms, we demonstrate multiplexed in situ HCR in diverse imaging settings: bacteria, whole-mount nematode larvae, whole-mount fruit fly embryos, whole-mount sea urchin embryos, whole-mount zebrafish larvae, whole-mount chicken embryos, whole-mount mouse embryos and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded human tissue sections. In addition to straightforward multiplexing, in situ HCR enables deep sample penetration, high contrast and subcellular resolution, providing an incisive tool for the study of interlaced and overlapping expression patterns, with implications for research communities across the biological sciences., Summary: Multiplexed in situ hybridisation chain reaction allows visualisation of multiple mRNAs in a single sample with subcellular resolution.

Infected and uninfected macrophages interdigitate, assuming an altered, flattened appearance. Although pathologists have described these changes for over a century, the molecular and cellular programs underlying this transition are unclear. Here, using the zebrafish-Mycobacterium marinum model, we found that mycobacterial granuloma formation is accompanied by macrophage induction of canonical epithelial molecules and structures. We identified fundamental macrophage reprogramming events that parallel E-cadherin-dependent mesenchymal-epithelial transitions. Macrophage-specific disruption of E-cadherin function resulted in disordered granuloma formation, enhanced immune cell access, decreased bacterial burden and increased host survival, suggesting that the granuloma can also serve a bacteria-protective role. Granuloma macrophages in humans with tuberculosis were similarly transformed. Thus, during mycobacterial infection, granuloma macrophages are broadly reprogrammed by epithelial modules, and this reprogramming alters the trajectory of infection and the associated immune response.,},

GFE3 is a fusion between an E3 ligase, which mediates the ubiquitination and rapid degradation of proteins, and a recombinant, antibody-like protein (FingR) that binds to Gephyrin. Expression of GFE3 leads to a strong and specific reduction of Gephyrin in culture or in vivo and to a substantial decrease in phasic inhibition onto cells that express GFE3. By temporarily expressing GFE3 we showed that inhibitory synapses regrow following ablation. Thus, we have created a simple, reversible method for modulating inhibitory synaptic input onto genetically determined cells., When studying neural circuitry, the ablation of synapses may be an alternative to optogenetic manipulation of neurons.

	abstract = {Purpose
Human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived retinal organoids are a platform for investigating retinal development, pathophysiology, and cellular therapies. In contrast to histologic analysis in which multiple specimens fixed at different times are used to reconstruct developmental processes, repeated analysis of the same living organoids provides a more direct means to characterize changes. New live imaging modalities can provide insights into retinal organoid structure and metabolic function during in vitro growth. This study employed live tissue imaging to characterize retinal organoid development, including metabolic changes accompanying photoreceptor differentiation.

Methods
Live hPSC-derived retinal organoids at different developmental stages were examined for microanatomic organization and metabolic function by phase contrast microscopy, optical coherence tomography (OCT), fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM), and hyperspectral imaging (HSpec). Features were compared to those revealed by histologic staining, immunostaining, and microcomputed tomography (micro-CT) of fixed organoid tissue.

Results
We used FLIM and HSpec to detect changes in metabolic activity as organoids differentiated into organized lamellae. FLIM detected increased glycolytic activity and HSpec detected retinol and retinoic acid accumulation in the organoid outer layer, coinciding with photoreceptor genesis. OCT enabled imaging of lamellae formed during organoid maturation. Micro-CT revealed three-dimensional structure, but failed to detect lamellae.

Conclusions
Live imaging modalities facilitate real-time and nondestructive imaging of retinal organoids as they organize into lamellar structures. FLIM and HSpec enable rapid detection of lamellar structure and photoreceptor metabolism. Live imaging techniques may aid in the continuous evaluation of retinal organoid development in diverse experimental and cell therapy settings.},

Here, we show that the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ reuptake pump (SERCA) directs budding across germ layers and species. Clonal knockdown demonstrated a cell-autonomous role for SERCA in Drosophila air sac budding. Live imaging of Drosophila tracheogenesis revealed elevated Ca2+ levels in migratory tip cells as they form branches. SERCA blockade abolished this Ca2+ differential, aborting both cell migration and new branching. Activating protein kinase C (PKC) rescued Ca2+ in tip cells and restored cell migration and branching. Likewise, inhibiting SERCA abolished mammalian epithelial budding, PKC activation rescued budding, while morphogens did not. Mesoderm (zebrafish angiogenesis) and ectoderm (Drosophila nervous system) behaved similarly, suggesting a conserved requirement for cell-autonomous Ca2+ signaling, established by SERCA, in iterative budding., Summary: Dynamic imaging of living embryos demonstrates that SERCA is a conserved regulator that controls cell migration and branching across species and germ layers, and PKC activation can rescue SERCA inhibition.

	abstract = {Cortical flow, the directed movement of cortical F-actin and
 cortical organelles, is a basic cellular motility process. Microtubules
 are thought to somehow direct cortical flow, but whether they do so by
 stimulating or inhibiting contraction of the cortical actin
 cytoskeleton is the subject of debate. Treatment of
 Xenopus oocytes with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate
 (PMA) triggers cortical flow toward the animal pole of the oocyte; this
 flow is suppressed by microtubules. To determine how this
 suppression occurs and whether it can control the direction of cortical
 flow, oocytes were subjected to localized manipulation of either the
 contractile stimulus (PMA) or microtubules. Localized PMA application
 resulted in redirection of cortical flow toward the site of
 application, as judged by movement of cortical pigment granules,
 cortical F-actin, and cortical myosin-2A. Such redirected flow was
 accelerated by microtubule depolymerization, showing that the
 suppression of cortical flow by microtubules is independent of the
 direction of flow. Direct observation of cortical F-actin by time-lapse
 confocal analysis in combination with photobleaching showed that
 cortical flow is driven by contraction of the cortical F-actin network
 and that microtubules suppress this contraction. The oocyte germinal
 vesicle serves as a microtubule organizing center in
 Xenopus oocytes; experimental displacement of the
 germinal vesicle toward the animal pole resulted in localized flow away
 from the animal pole. The results show that 1) cortical flow is
 directed toward areas of localized contraction of the cortical F-actin
 cytoskeleton; 2) microtubules suppress cortical flow by inhibiting
 contraction of the cortical F-actin cytoskeleton; and 3) localized,
 microtubule-dependent suppression of actomyosin-based contraction can
 control the direction of cortical flow. We discuss these findings in
 light of current models of cortical flow.},

Here, we describe growing evidence for a third form of exocytosis, dubbed “kiss-and-coat,” which is characteristic of a broad variety of cell types that undergo regulated exocytosis. Kiss-and-coat exocytosis entails prolonged maintenance of a dilated fusion pore and assembly of actin filament (F-actin) coats around the exocytosing secretory vesicles followed by direct retrieval of some fraction of the emptied vesicle membrane. We propose that assembly of the actin coats results from the union of the secretory vesicle membrane and PM and that this compartment mixing represents a general mechanism for generating local signals via directed membrane fusion.},

In activated Xenopus eggs, exocytosing cortical granules (CGs) are surrounded by actin “coats,” which compress the exocytosing compartments, resulting in compensatory endocytosis. Here, we examined the roles of two myosins in actin coat compression. Myosin-2 is recruited to exocytosing CGs late in coat compression. Inhibition of myosin-2 slows coat compression without affecting actin assembly. This differs from phenotype induced by inhibition of actin assembly, where exocytosing CGs are trapped at the plasma membrane (PM) completely. Thus, coat compression is likely driven in part by actin assembly itself, but it requires myosin-2 for efficient completion. In contrast to myosin-2, the long-tailed myosin-1e is recruited to exocytosing CGs immediately after egg activation. Perturbation of myosin-1e results in partial actin coat assembly and induces CG collapse into the PM. Intriguingly, simultaneous inhibition of actin assembly and myosin-1e prevents CG collapse.

To define the basic principles governing microtubule/F-actin interactions, we used dual-wavelength digital fluorescence and fluorescent speckle microscopy to analyze microtubules and F-actin labeled with spectrally distinct fluorophores in interphase Xenopus egg extracts. In the absence of microtubules, networks of F-actin bundles zippered together or exhibited serpentine gliding along the coverslip. When microtubules were nucleated from Xenopus sperm centrosomes, they were released and translocated away from the aster center. In the presence of microtubules, F-actin exhibited two distinct, microtubule-dependent motilities: rapid (∼250–300 nm/s) jerking and slow (∼50 nm/s), straight gliding. Microtubules remodeled the F-actin network, as F-actin jerking caused centrifugal clearing of F-actin from around aster centers. F-actin jerking occurred when F-actin bound to motile microtubules powered by cytoplasmic dynein. F-actin straight gliding occurred when F-actin bundles translocated along the microtubule lattice. These interactions required Xenopus cytosolic factors. Localization of myosin-II to F-actin suggested it may power F-actin zippering, while localization of myosin-V on microtubules suggested it could mediate interactions between microtubules and F-actin. We examine current models for cytokinesis and cell motility in light of these findings.},

We analyzed this process in living oocytes using confocal time-lapse (four-dimensional) microscopy. Closure of wounds requires assembly and contraction of a classic “contractile ring” composed of F-actin and myosin 2. However, this ring works in concert with a 5–10-μm wide “zone” of localized actin and myosin 2 assembly. The zone forms before the ring and can be uncoupled from the ring by inhibition of cortical flow and contractility. However, contractility and the contractile ring are required for the stability and forward movement of the zone, as revealed by changes in zone dynamics after disruption of contractility and flow, or experimentally induced breakage of the contractile ring. We conclude that wound-induced contractile arrays are provided with their characteristic flexibility, speed, and strength by the combined input of two distinct components: a highly dynamic zone in which myosin 2 and actin preferentially assemble, and a stable contractile actomyosin ring.},

Although the roles of microtubules and microtubule-based motors in mitotic spindles are well established, whether or not actin filaments (F-actin) and F-actin–based motors (myosins) are required components of mitotic spindles has long been controversial. Based on the demonstration that myosin-10 (Myo10) is important for assembly of meiotic spindles, we assessed the role of this unconventional myosin, as well as F-actin, in mitotic spindles. We find that Myo10 localizes to mitotic spindle poles and is essential for proper spindle anchoring, normal spindle length, spindle pole integrity, and progression through metaphase. Furthermore, we show that F-actin localizes to mitotic spindles in dynamic cables that surround the spindle and extend between the spindle and the cortex. Remarkably, although proper anchoring depends on both F-actin and Myo10, the requirement for Myo10 in spindle pole integrity is F-actin independent, whereas F-actin and Myo10 actually play antagonistic roles in maintenance of spindle length.},

Formation of the contractile ring is dependent on the small GTPase, RhoA,, which is activated in a precise zone at the cell equator. It has long been assumed that cytokinesis and other Rho-dependent processes are controlled in a sequential manner, whereby Rho activation via guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) initiates a particular event, and Rho inactivation via GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) terminates that event. MgcRacGAP is a conserved cytokinesis regulator thought to be required only at the end of cytokinesis,. Here we show that MgcRacGAP’s GAP activity is necessary early during cytokinesis for the formation and maintenance of the Rho activity zone. Disruption of GAP activity by point mutation results in poorly focused Rho activity zones, while complete removal of the GAP domain results in unfocused zones that display lateral instability and/or rapid side-to-side oscillations. We propose that the GAP domain of MgcRacGAP plays two unexpected roles throughout cytokinesis: first, it transiently anchors active Rho, and second it promotes local Rho inactivation resulting in the constant flux of Rho through the GTPase cycle.},

We used live imaging in urchin and frog embryos to evaluate the relationship between microtubule organization and cytokinetic furrow position. In normal cells, the cytokinetic apparatus forms in a region of lower cortical microtubule density. Remarkably, cells depleted of astral microtubules conduct accurate, complete cytokinesis. Conversely, in anucleate cells, asters alone can support furrow induction without a spindle, but only when sufficiently separated. Ablation of a single centrosome displaces furrows away from the remaining centrosome; ablation of both centrosomes causes broad, inefficient furrowing.

Prior to exocytosis, myosin1e relocates to the surface of cortical granules. Overexpression of myosin1e augments the kinetics of cortical granule exocytosis, whereas tail-derived fragments of myosin1e inhibit this secretory event (but not constitutive exocytosis). Finally, intracellular injection of myosin1e antibody inhibits cortical granule exocytosis. Further experiments identified cysteine string proteins as interacting partners for myosin1e. As constituents of the membrane of cortical granules, cysteine string proteins are also essential for cortical granule exocytosis.

Upon calcium-induced exocytosis, XlMyo1c is recruited to exocytosing CG membranes where actin coats then assemble. When XlMyo1c function is disrupted, actin coats assemble, but dynamic actin filaments are uncoupled from the exocytosing CG membranes such that coats do not compress, and compensatory endocytosis fails.

	abstract = {Background
The RhoGTPases—Rho, Rac and Cdc42—regulate the dynamics of F-actin (filamentous actin) and myosin-2 with considerable subcellular precision. Consistent with this ability, active Rho and Cdc42 occupy mutually exclusive zones during single cell wound repair and asymmetric cytokinesis, suggesting the existence of mechanisms for local crosstalk, but how local Rho GTPase crosstalk is controlled is unknown.

Results
Using a candidate screen approach for Rho GTPase activators (Guanine nucleotide exchange factors; GEFs) and Rho GTPase inactivators (GTPase activating proteins; GAPs), we find that Abr, a protein with both GEF and GAP activity, regulates Rho and Cdc42 during single cell wound repair. Abr is targeted to the Rho activity zone via active Rho. Within the Rho zone Abr promotes local Rho activation via its GEF domain and controls local crosstalk via its GAP domain, which limits Cdc42 activity within the Rho zone. Depletion of Abr attenuates Rho activity and wound repair.

Conclusions
Abr is the first identified Rho GTPase regulator of single cell wound healing. Its novel mode of targeting by interaction with active Rho allows Abr to rapidly amplify local increases in Rho activity using its GEF domain while its ability to inactivate Cdc42 using its GAP domain results in sharp segregation of the Rho and Cdc42 zones. Similar mechanisms of local Rho GTPase activation and segregation enforcement may be employed in other processes that exhibit local Rho GTPase crosstalk.},

	abstract = {Aurora B (Aur-B) plays multiple roles in mitosis, of which the best known are to ensure bi-orientation of sister chromatids by destabilizing incorrectly attached kinetochore microtubules and to participate in cytokinesis. Studies in Xenopus egg extracts, however, have indicated that Aur-B and the chromosome passenger complex play an important role in stabilizing chromosome-associated spindle microtubules. Aur-B stabilizes spindle microtubules in the egg extracts by inhibiting the catastrophe kinesin MCAK. Whether or not Aur-B plays a similar role in intact oocytes remains unknown. Here we have employed a dominant-negative Aur-B mutant (Aur-B122R, in which the ATP-binding lysine122 is replaced with arginine) to investigate the function of Aur-B in spindle assembly in Xenopus oocytes undergoing meiosis. Overexpression of Aur-B122R results in short bipolar spindles or monopolar spindles, with higher concentrations of Aur-B122R producing mostly the latter. Simultaneous inhibition of MCAK translation in oocytes overexpressing Aur-B122R results in suppression of monopolar phenotype, suggesting that Aur-B regulates spindle bipolarity by inhibiting MCAK. Furthermore, recombinant MCAK-4A protein, which lacks all four Aur-B phosphoryaltion sites and is therefore insensitive to Aur-B inhibition but not wild-type MCAK, recapitulated the monopolar phenotype in the oocytes. These results suggest that in vertebrate oocytes that lack centrosomes, one major function of Aur-B is to stabilize chromosome-associated spindle microtubules to ensure spindle bipolarity.},

	abstract = {Contractile arrays of actin filaments (F-actin) and myosin-2 power diverse biological processes. Contractile array formation is stimulated by the Rho GTPases Rho and Cdc42; after assembly, array movement is thought to result from contraction itself. Contractile array movement and GTPase activity were analyzed during cellular wound repair, in which arrays close in association with zones of Rho and Cdc42 activity. Remarkably, contraction suppression prevents translocation of F-actin and myosin-2 without preventing array or zone closure. Closure is driven by an underlying “signal treadmill” in which the GTPases are preferentially activated at the leading edges and preferentially lost from the trailing edges of their zones. Treadmill organization requires myosin-2 powered contraction and F-actin turnover. Thus, directional gradients in Rho GTPase turnover impart directional information to contractile arrays and proper functioning of these gradients is dependent on both contraction and F-actin turnover.},

Critical to this process is the attachment of one spindle pole to the oocyte cortex prior to anaphase. We report here that asymmetric spindle pole attachment and anaphase initiation are required for localized cortical activation of Cdc42, which in turn defines the surface of the impending polar body. The Cdc42 activity zone overlaps with dynamic F-actin, and is circumscribed by a RhoA-based actomyosin contractile ring. During cytokinesis, constriction of the RhoA contractile ring is accompanied by Cdc42-mediated membrane outpocketing such that one spindle pole and one set of chromosomes are pulled into the Cdc42 enclosure. Unexpectedly, the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Ect2, which is necessary for contractile ring formation, does not co-localize with active RhoA. Polar body emission thus requires a classical RhoA contractile ring and Cdc42-mediated membrane protrusion.},

To date, however, most screens of small molecule libraries have focused on identification of compounds that inhibit known proteins or particular steps in a given process, and have emphasized automated primary screens. Here we have used “low tech” in vivo primary screens to identify small molecules that inhibit both cytokinesis and single cell wound repair, two complex cellular processes that possess many common features. The “diversity set”, an ordered array of 1990 compounds available from the National Cancer Institute, was screened in parallel to identify compounds that inhibit cytokinesis in D. excentricus (sand dollar) embryos and single cell wound repair in X. laevis (frog) oocytes. Two small molecules were thus identified: Sph1 and Sph2. Sph1 reduces Rho activation in wound repair and suppresses formation of the spindle midzone during cytokinesis. Sph2 also reduces Rho activation in wound repair and may inhibit cytokinesis by blocking membrane fusion. The results identify two small molecules of interest for analysis of wound repair and cytokinesis, reveal that these processes are more similar than often realized and reveal the potential power of low tech screens of small molecule libraries for analysis of complex cellular processes.},

These processes are considered distinct, but one mode of healing—Rho GTPase-dependent formation and closure of a purse string of actin filaments (F-actin) and myosin-2 around wounds—occurs in single cells (,) and in epithelia (-). Here we show that wounding of one cell in Xenopus embryos elicits Rho GTPase activation around the wound and at the nearest cell-cell junctions in the neighbor cells. F-actin and myosin-2 accumulate at the junctions as well as around the wound itself, and as the resultant actomyosin array closes over the wound site, junctional F-actin and myosin-2 become mechanically integrated with the actin and myosin-2 around the wound, forming a hybrid purse string. When cells are ablated rather than wounded, Rho GTPase activation and F-actin accumulation occur at cell-cell junctions surrounding the ablated cell, and the purse string closes the hole in the epithelium. Elevation of intracellular free calcium, an essential upstream signal for the single cell wound response (,), also occurs at the cell-cell contacts and in neighbor cells. Thus, the single and multicellular purse string wound responses represent points on a signaling and mechanical continuum that are integrated by cell-cell junctions.},

The model replicates basic features of zone segregation and dynamics, reveals that Rho and Cdc42 activities represent spatially modulated bistability, and makes nonintuitive predictions confirmed by experiment. , The Rho GTPases—Rho, Rac, and Cdc42—control an enormous variety of processes, many of which reflect activation of these GTPases in spatially confined and mutually exclusive zones. By using mathematical models and experimental results to establish model parameters, we analyze the formation and segregation of Rho and Cdc42 zones during Xenopus oocyte wound repair and the role played by Abr, a dual guanine nucleotide exchange factor–GTPase-activating protein, in this process. The Rho and Cdc42 zones are found to be best represented as manifestations of spatially modulated bistability, and local positive feedback between Abr and Rho can account for the maintenance and dynamic properties of the Rho zone. In contrast, the invocation of an Abr-independent positive feedback loop is required to account for Cdc42 spatial bistability. In addition, the model replicates the results of previous in vivo experiments in which Abr activity is manipulated. Further, simulating the model with two closely spaced wounds made nonintuitive predictions about the Rho and Cdc42 patterns; these predictions were confirmed by experiment. We conclude that the model is a useful tool for analysis of Rho GTPase signaling and that the Rho GTPases can be fruitfully considered as components of intracellular pattern formation systems.},

Formation of the cytokinetic apparatus is at least partially dependent on the small GTPase, Rho. Similar to other small GTPases, Rho cycles between the active (GTP-bound) and inactive (GDP-bound) states. Because of this switch-like behaviour, Rho and other members of the Rho GTPase family, such as Rac and Cdc42, have long been thought to work in a manner such that their activation and inactivation are not tightly coupled. That is, a given Rho-dependent event, such as cytokinesis, has been thought to be initiated by activation of Rho, and then, many minutes later, terminated by inactivation of Rho. Here we discuss evidence suggesting that in fact Rho undergoes rapid movement through the GTPase cycle throughout the entire process of cytokinesis, and that this cycling is necessary for proper cytokinetic apparatus function.},

However, how microtubules regulate leukocyte migration is not well understood, particularly in living organisms. Here we exploited the zebrafish system to study the role of microtubules in neutrophil migration in vivo. The localization of microtubules was visualized in motile neutrophils using various bioprobes, revealing that, in contrast to what has been seen in studies in vitro, the microtubule organizing center is positioned in front of the nucleus (relative to the direction of migration) in motile neutrophils. Microtubule disassembly impaired attraction of neutrophils to wounds but enhanced the polarity of F-actin dynamics as measured by the distribution of stable and dynamic F-actin. Microtubule depolymerization inhibited polarized phosphoinositol 3-kinase (PI(3)K) activation at the leading edge and induced rapid PI(3)K independent motility. Finally, we show that microtubules exert their effects on neutrophil polarity and motility at least in part by the negative regulation of both Rho and Rac activity. These results provide new insight into the role of microtubules in neutrophil migration in a living vertebrate and show that the motility of these professional migratory cells are subject to distinctly different rules from those established for other cell types.},

Cell damage triggers the rapid accumulation of several different lipids around wounds, and the lipids sort into distinct domains around them. One of these lipids—diacylglycerol—is required for activation of Rho and Cdc42 and healing., After damage, cells reseal their plasma membrane and repair the underlying cortical cytoskeleton. Although many different proteins have been implicated in cell repair, the potential role of specific lipids has not been explored. Here we report that cell damage elicits rapid formation of spatially organized lipid domains around the damage site, with different lipids concentrated in different domains as a result of both de novo synthesis and transport. One of these lipids—diacylglycerol (DAG)—rapidly accumulates in a broad domain that overlaps the zones of active Rho and Cdc42, GTPases that regulate repair of the cortical cytoskeleton. Formation of the DAG domain is required for Cdc42 and Rho activation and healing. Two DAG targets, protein kinase C (PKC) β and η, are recruited to cell wounds and play mutually antagonistic roles in the healing process: PKCβ participates in Rho and Cdc42 activation, whereas PKCη inhibits Rho and Cdc42 activation. The results reveal an unexpected diversity in subcellular lipid domains and the importance of such domains for a basic cellular process.},

This suggests that a common signaling ensemble underlies all functional cytokinetic furrow induction events., Cytokinesis in animal cells depends on spindle-derived spatial cues that culminate in Rho activation, and thereby actomyosin assembly, in a narrow equatorial band. Although the nature, origin, and variety of such cues have long been obscure, one component is certainly the Rho activator Ect2. Here we describe the behavior and function of Ect2 in echinoderm embryos, showing that Ect2 migrates from spindle midzone to astral microtubules in anaphase and that Ect2 shapes the pattern of Rho activation in incipient furrows. Our key finding is that Ect2 and its binding partner Cyk4 accumulate not only at normal furrows, but also at furrows that form in the absence of associated spindle, midzone, or chromosomes. In all these cases, the cell assembles essentially the same cytokinetic signaling ensemble—opposed astral microtubules decorated with Ect2 and Cyk4. We conclude that if multiple signals contribute to furrow induction in echinoderm embryos, they likely converge on the same signaling ensemble on an analogous cytoskeletal scaffold.},

	abstract = {During vertebrate egg maturation, cytokinesis initiates after one pole of the bipolar metaphase I spindle attaches to the oocyte cortex, resulting in the formation of a polar body and the mature egg. It is not known what signal couples the spindle pole positioning to polar body formation. We approached this question by drawing an analogy to mitotic exit in budding yeast, as asymmetric spindle attachment to the appropriate cortical region is the common regulatory cue. In budding yeast, the small G protein Cdc42 plays an important role in mitotic exit following the spindle pole attachment []. We show here that inhibition of Cdc42 activation blocks polar body formation. The oocytes initiate anaphase but fail to properly form and direct a contractile ring. Endogenous Cdc42 is activated at the spindle pole-cortical contact site immediately prior to polar body formation. The cortical Cdc42 activity zone, which directly overlays the spindle pole, is circumscribed by a cortical RhoA activity zone; the latter defines the cytokinetic contractile furrow []. As the RhoA ring contracts during cytokinesis, the Cdc42 zone expands, maintaining its complementary relationship with the RhoA ring. Cdc42 signaling may thus be an evolutionarily conserved mechanism that couples spindle positioning to asymmetric cytokinesis.},

	abstract = {Local actin assembly is associated with sites of exocytosis in processes ranging from phagocytosis to compensatory endocytosis. Here, we examine whether the trigger for actin-coat assembly around exocytosing Xenopus egg cortical granules is ‘compartment mixing’ — the union of the contents of the plasma membrane with that of the secretory granule membrane. Consistent with this model, compartment mixing occurs on cortical granule–plasma membrane fusion and is required for actin assembly. Compartment mixing triggers actin assembly, at least in part, through diacylglycerol (DAG), which incorporates into the cortical granule membranes from the plasma membrane after cortical granule–plasma membrane fusion. DAG, in turn, directs long-term recruitment protein kinase Cβ (PKCβ) to exocytosing cortical granules, where it is required for activation of Cdc42 localized on the cortical granules. The results demonstrate that mixing of two membrane compartments can direct local actin assembly and indicate that this process is harnessed during Xenopus egg cortical granule exocytosis to drive compensatory endocytosis.},

Cytokinesis is restricted to a portion of the cell cycle following anaphase onset in which the cortex is responsive to signals from the spindle. We show that shortly after anaphase onset oocytes and embryonic cells of frogs and echinoderms exhibit cortical waves of Rho activity and F-actin polymerization. The waves are modulated by cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) activity and require the Rho GEF (guanine nucleotide exchange factor), Ect2. Surprisingly, during wave propagation, while Rho activity elicits F-actin assembly, F-actin subsequently inactivates Rho. Experimental and modeling results show that waves represent excitable dynamics of a reaction diffusion system with Rho as the activator and F-actin the inhibitor. We propose that cortical excitability explains fundamental features of cytokinesis including its cell cycle regulation.},

However, several relatively recent developments have added new impetus to wound repair research: the increasing application of model systems; the growing recognition that single cells have a robust, complex, and medically relevant wound healing response; and the emerging recognition that different modes of wound repair bear an uncanny resemblance to other basic biological processes such as morphogenesis and cytokinesis. In this review, each of these developments is described, and their significance for wound healing research is considered. In addition, overlapping mechanisms of single-cell and multicellular wound healing are highlighted, and it is argued that they are more similar than is often recognized. Based on this and other information, a simple model to explain the evolutionary relationships of cytokinesis, single-cell wound repair, multicellular wound repair, and developmental morphogenesis is proposed.

	abstract = {Emergence of the cytokinetic Rho zone that orchestrates formation and ingression of the cleavage furrow had been explained previously via microtubule-dependent cortical concentration of Ect2, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rho. The results of a recent publication now demonstrate that, en route from resting cortex to fully established furrow, there lies a regime of cortical excitability in which Rho activity and F-actin play the roles of the prototypical activator and inhibitor, respectively. This cortical excitability is manifest as dramatic traveling waves on the cortex of oocytes and embryos of frogs and starfish. These waves are initiated by autocatalytic activation of Rho at the wave front and extinguished by F-actin-dependent inhibition at their back. It is still unclear how propagating excitable Rho-actin waves give rise to the stable co-existence of Rho activity and F-actin density in the static cleavage furrow during cytokinesis. It is possible that some central spindle-associated signaling molecule simply turns off the inhibition of Rho activity by F-actin. However, mathematical modeling suggests a distinct scenario in which local “re-wiring” of the Rho-actin coupling in the furrow is no longer necessary. Instead, the model predicts that the continuously rising level of Ect2 produces in the furrow a qualitatively new stable steady state that replaces excitability and brings about the stable co-existence of high Rho activity and dense F-actin despite the continuing inhibition of Rho by F-actin.},

High-speed microscopy reveals this process and shows that resealing is accompanied by intracellular patterning of proteins, ions, and membrane lipids., Cells rapidly reseal after damage, but how they do so is unknown. It has been hypothesized that resealing occurs due to formation of a patch derived from rapid fusion of intracellular compartments at the wound site. However, patching has never been directly visualized. Here we study membrane dynamics in wounded Xenopus laevis oocytes at high spatiotemporal resolution. Consistent with the patch hypothesis, we find that damage triggers rampant fusion of intracellular compartments, generating a barrier that limits influx of extracellular dextrans. Patch formation is accompanied by compound exocytosis, local accumulation and aggregation of vesicles, and rupture of compartments facing the external environment. Subcellular patterning is evident as annexin A1, dysferlin, diacylglycerol, active Rho, and active Cdc42 are recruited to compartments confined to different regions around the wound. We also find that a ring of elevated intracellular calcium overlaps the region where membrane dynamics are most evident and persists for several minutes. The results provide the first direct visualization of membrane patching during membrane repair, reveal novel features of the repair process, and show that a remarkable degree of spatial patterning accompanies damage-induced membrane dynamics.},

	abstract = {Rho GTPases are regulatory proteins whose patterns on the surface of a cell affect cell polarization, cell motility and repair of single-cell wounds. The stereotypical patterns formed by two such proteins, Rho and Cdc42, around laser-injured frog oocytes permit experimental analysis of GTPase activation, inactivation, segregation and crosstalk. Here, we review the development and analysis of a spatial model of GTPase dynamics that describe the formation of concentric zones of Rho and Cdc42 activity around wounds, and describe how this model has provided insights into the roles of the GTPase effector molecules protein kinase C (PKCβ and PKCη) and guanosine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI) in the wound response. We further demonstrate how the use of a ‘sharp switch’ model approximation in combination with bifurcation analysis can aid mapping the model behaviour in parameter space (approximate results confirmed with numerical simulation methods). Using these methods in combination with experimental manipulation of PKC activity (PKC overexpression (OE) and dominant negative conditions), we have shown that: (i) PKCβ most probably acts by enhancing existing positive feedbacks (from Rho to itself via the guanosine nucleotide exchange factor domain of Abr, and from Cdc42 to itself), (ii) PKCη most probably increases basal rates of inactivation (or possibly decreases basal rates of activation) of Rho and Cdc42, and (iii) the graded distribution of PKCη and its effect on initial Rho activity accounts for inversion of zones in a fraction (20\%) of PKCη OE cells. Finally, we speculate that GDIs (which sequester GTPases) may have a critical role in defining the spatial domain, where the wound response may occur. This paper provides a more thorough exposition of the methods of analysis used in the investigation, whereas previous work on this topic was addressed to biologists and abbreviated such discussion.},

	abstract = {A novel mitotic spindle-tracking program reveals stereotyped spindle rotational movements in the embryonic epithelium of Xenopus laevis during metaphase. These movements position and center the spindle within the cell. This analysis also suggests that contacts between the spindle and cortex are correlated with the decision to enter anaphase., Proper spindle positioning at anaphase onset is essential for normal tissue organization and function. Here we develop automated spindle-tracking software and apply it to characterize mitotic spindle dynamics in the Xenopus laevis embryonic epithelium. We find that metaphase spindles first undergo a sustained rotation that brings them on-axis with their final orientation. This sustained rotation is followed by a set of striking stereotyped rotational oscillations that bring the spindle into near contact with the cortex and then move it rapidly away from the cortex. These oscillations begin to subside soon before anaphase onset. Metrics extracted from the automatically tracked spindles indicate that final spindle position is determined largely by cell morphology and that spindles consistently center themselves in the XY-plane before anaphase onset. Finally, analysis of the relationship between spindle oscillations and spindle position relative to the cortex reveals an association between cortical contact and anaphase onset. We conclude that metaphase spindles in epithelia engage in a stereotyped “dance,” that this dance culminates in proper spindle positioning and orientation, and that completion of the dance is linked to anaphase onset.},

How mechanical stimuli such as stiffness of the extracellular matrix (ECM) contribute to MSC phenotype in cancer remains poorly understood. Here, we show that ECM stiffness leads to mechano-signal transduction in MSC, which promotes mammary tumor growth in part through secretion of the signaling protein prosaposin. On a stiff matrix, MSC cultured with conditioned media from mammary cancer cells expressed increased levels of α-smooth muscle actin, a marker of CAF, compared with MSC cultured on a soft matrix. By contrast, MSC cultured on a stiff matrix secreted prosaposin that promoted proliferation and survival of mammary carcinoma cells but inhibited metastasis. Our findings suggest that in addition to chemical stimuli, increased stiffness of the ECM in the tumor microenvironment induces differentiation of MSC to CAF, triggering enhanced proliferation and survival of mammary cancer cells.

	abstract = {Cell transformation and tumor progression involve a common set of acquired capabilities, including increased proliferation, failure of cell death, self-sufficiency in growth, angiogenesis, and tumor cell invasion and metastasis. The stromal environment consists of many cell types and various extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins that support normal tissue maintenance and which have been implicated in tumor progression. Both the chemical and mechanical properties of the ECM have been shown to influence normal and malignant cell behavior. For instance, mesenchymal stem cells differentiate into specific lineages that are dependent on matrix stiffness, while tumor cells undergo changes in cell behavior and gene expression in response to matrix stiffness. ECM remodeling is implicated in tumor progression and can result in increased deposition of stromal ECM, enhanced contraction of ECM fibrils, and altered collagen alignment and ECM stiffness. Tumor cells respond to changes in ECM remodeling through altered intracellular signaling and cell cycle control that lead to enhanced proliferation, loss of normal tissue architecture, and local tumor cell migration and invasion. This review focuses on the bi-directional interplay between the mechanical properties of the ECM and integrin-mediated signal transduction events in an effort to elucidate cell behaviors during tumor progression.},

The models of shear stress used to analyze the effects of loading bone cells in vitro include both oscillatory and unidirectional fluid shear profiles. Although the fluid flow profile experienced by cells within bone is most likely oscillatory in nature, to date there have been few direct comparisons of how bone cells respond to these two fluid flow profiles. In this study we evaluated morphologic and biochemical responses to a time course of unidirectional and oscillatory fluid flow in two commonly used bone cell lines, MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts and MLO-Y4 osteocytes. We determined that stress fibers formed and aligned within osteoblasts after 1 h of unidirectional fluid flow, but this response was not observed until greater than 5 h of oscillatory fluid flow. Despite the delay in stress fiber formation, oscillatory and unidirectional fluid flow profiles elicited similar temporal effects on the induction of both cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) and osteopontin protein expression in osteoblasts. Interestingly, MLO-Y4 osteocytes formed organized stress fibers after exposure to 24 h of unidirectional shear stress, while the number of dendritic processes per cell increased along with Cox-2 protein levels after 24 h of oscillatory shear stress. Despite these differences, both flow profiles significantly altered osteopontin levels in MLO-Y4 osteocytes. Together these results demonstrate that the profile of fluid shear can induce significantly different responses from osteoblasts and osteocytes.},

	abstract = {Mechanical loading of bone is important for the structural integrity of the skeleton and the maintenance of bone mass. Mechanically loading bone generates fluid shear stress (FSS) across the surface of bone cells resulting in the induction of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and release of prostaglandins, both of which are necessary for mechanically induced bone formation. However, the mechanisms by which cells transduce FSS-induced signals across the membrane and into the cell remain poorly understood. Focal adhesions, which are specialized sites of attachment between cells and the extracellular matrix, play a role in signal transduction and have been proposed to function as mechanosensors. To directly test whether focal adhesions mediate mechanotransduction in bone cells, we inhibited the formation of focal adhesions by 1). culturing MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts on bovine serum albumin (BSA), which does not contain integrin binding sites or by 2). treating cells cultured on fibronectin with soluble Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (RGDS) peptide to specifically block integrin-fibronectin interactions. We then subjected the cells to FSS and measured COX-2 induction and PGE(2) release. Both COX-2 induction and PGE(2) release in response to FSS were significantly decreased when osteoblasts were treated with soluble RGDS peptide compared with controls. However, RGDS peptide treatment did not affect FSS-induced ERK phosphorylation. Interestingly, osteoblasts cultured on BSA to suppress focal adhesion formation secreted fibronectin and increased focal adhesion formation over time, which correlated with the induction of COX-2 in response to FSS. Together, these results suggest that fibronectin-induced formation of focal adhesions promotes FSS-induced PGE(2) release and upregulation of COX-2 protein.},

The cytoskeletal network is thought to play an important role in the transmission and conversion of a mechanical stimulus into a biochemical response. To examine a role for the three different cytoskeletal networks in fluid shear stress-induced signaling in osteoblasts, we individually disrupted actin microfilaments, micro-tubules, and intermediate filaments in MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts with multiple pharmacological agents. We subjected these cells to 90 min of laminar fluid shear stress (10 dyn/cm(2)) and compared the PGE(2) and PGI(2) release and induction of cyclooxygenase-2 protein to control cells with intact cytoskeletons. Disruption of actin microfilaments, microtubules, or intermediate filaments in MC3T3-E1 cells did not prevent a significant fluid shear stress-induced release of PGE(2) or PGI(2). Furthermore, disruption of actin microfilaments or microtubules did not prevent a significant fluid shear stress-induced increase in cyclooxygenase-2 protein levels. Disruption of intermediate filaments with acrylamide did prevent the fluid shear stress-induced increase in cyclooxygenase-2 but also prevented a PGE(2)-induced increase in cyclooxygenase-2. Thus none of the three major cytoskeletal networks are required for fluid shear stress-induced prostaglandin release. Furthermore, although neither actin microfilaments nor microtubules are required for fluid shear stress-induced increase in cyclooxygenase-2 levels, the role of intermediate filaments in regulation of cyclooxygenase-2 expression is less clear.},

	abstract = {In bone, a large proportion of osteoblasts, the cells responsible for deposition of new bone, normally undergo programmed cell death (apoptosis). Because mechanical loading of bone increases the rate of new bone formation, we hypothesized that mechanical stimulation of osteoblasts might increase their survival. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the effects of fluid shear stress (FSS) on osteoblast apoptosis using three osteoblast cell types: primary rat calvarial osteoblasts (RCOB), MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells, and UMR106 osteosarcoma cells. Cells were treated with TNF-alpha in the presence of cyclohexamide (CHX) to rapidly induce apoptosis. Osteoblasts showed significant signs of apoptosis within 4-6 h of exposure to TNF-alpha and CHX, and application of FSS (12 dyne/cm(2)) significantly attenuated this TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis. FSS activated PI3-kinase signaling, induced phosphorylation of Akt, and inhibited TNF-alpha-induced activation of caspase-3. Inhibition of PI3-kinase, using LY294002, blocked the ability of FSS to rescue osteoblasts from TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis and blocked FSS-induced inhibition of caspase-3 activation in osteoblasts treated with TNF-alpha. LY294002 did not, however, prevent FSS-induced phosphorylation of Akt suggesting that activation of Akt alone is not sufficient to rescue cells from apoptosis. This result also suggests that FSS can activate Akt via a PI3-kinase-independent pathway. These studies demonstrate for the first time that application of FSS to osteoblasts in vitro results in inhibition of TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis through a mechanism involving activation of PI3-kinase signaling and inhibition of caspases. FSS-induced activation of PI3-kinase may promote cell survival through a mechanism that is distinct from the Akt-mediated survival pathway.},

	abstract = {Mammographically dense breast tissue is one of the greatest risk factors for developing breast carcinoma, yet the associated molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. Importantly, regions of high breast density are associated with increased stromal collagen and epithelial cell content. We set out to determine whether increased collagen-matrix density, in the absence of stromal cells, was sufficient to promote proliferation and invasion characteristic of a malignant phenotype in non-transformed mammary epithelial cells. We demonstrate that increased collagen-matrix density increases matrix stiffness to promote an invasive phenotype. High matrix stiffness resulted in increased formation of activated three-dimensional (3D)-matrix adhesions and a chronically elevated outside-in/inside-out focal adhesion (FA) kinase (FAK)-Rho signaling loop, which was necessary to generate and maintain the invasive phenotype. Moreover, this signaling network resulted in hyperactivation of the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, which promoted growth of mammary epithelial cells in vitro and in vivo and activated a clinically relevant proliferation signature that predicts patient outcome. Hence, the current data provide compelling evidence for the importance of the mechanical features of the microenvironment, and suggest that mechanotransduction in these cells occurs through a FAK-Rho-ERK signaling network with extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) as a bottleneck through which much of the response to mechanical stimuli is regulated. As such, we propose that increased matrix stiffness explains part of the mechanism behind increased epithelial proliferation and cancer risk in human patients with high breast tissue density.},

Here we further define the signaling pathways that drive this response and show that Cdc42-mediated migration relies on the adaptor molecule p130(Cas). Activated Cdc42 enhanced p130(Cas) phosphorylation and its binding to Crk. Cdc42-driven migration and p130(Cas) phosphorylation were dependent on the Cdc42 effector Ack1 (activated Cdc42-associated kinase). Ack1 formed a signaling complex that also included Cdc42, p130(Cas), and Crk, formation of which was regulated by collagen stimulation. The interaction between Ack1 and p130(Cas) occurred through their respective SH3 domains, while the substrate domain of p130(Cas) was the major site of Ack1-dependent phosphorylation. Signaling through this complex is functionally relevant, because treatment with either p130(Cas) or Ack1 siRNA blocked Cdc42-induced migration. These results suggest that Cdc42 exerts its effects on cell migration in part through its effector Ack1, which regulates p130(Cas) signaling.},

Dynamic analysis of cell spreading by total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy demonstrated that active R-Ras lengthened the duration of initial membrane protrusion, and promoted the formation of a ruffling lamellipod, rich in branched actin structures and devoid of filopodia. By contrast, dominant-negative R-Ras enhanced filopodia formation. Moreover, RNA interference (RNAi) approaches demonstrated that endogenous R-Ras contributed to cell spreading. These observations suggest that R-Ras regulates membrane protrusions through organization of the actin cytoskeleton. Our results suggest that phospholipase Cepsilon (PLCepsilon) is a novel R-Ras effector mediating the effects of R-Ras on the actin cytoskeleton and membrane protrusion, because R-Ras was co-precipitated with PLCepsilon and increased its activity. Knockdown of PLCepsilon with siRNA reduced the formation of the ruffling lamellipod in R-Ras cells. Consistent with this pathway, inhibitors of PLC activity, or chelating intracellular Ca2+ abolished the ability of R-Ras to promote membrane protrusions and spreading. Overall, these data suggest that R-Ras signaling regulates the organization of the actin cytoskeleton to sustain membrane protrusion through the activity of PLCepsilon.},

Through systematic analysis of FLIM data from the control cells, it was observed that there is a statistically significant decrease in the fluorescence lifetime of both free and protein-bound NADH and the contribution of protein-bound NADH as cells progress from an early to logarithmic to confluent phase. Potassium cyanide (KCN) treatment and serum starvation of cells yielded similar changes. There was a statistically significant decrease in the fluorescence lifetime of protein-bound and free NADH at the early and logarithmic phase of the growth curve and a statistically significant decrease in the contribution of protein-bound NADH relative to that observed in the control cells at all three phases of the growth curve. The imposed perturbations (confluence, serum starvation, and KCN treatment) are all expected to result in an increase in the ratio of NADH/NAD+.

	volume = {23},
	issn = {0270-7306},
	abstract = {R-Ras regulates integrin function, but its effects on integrin signaling pathways have not been well described. We demonstrate that activation of R-Ras promoted focal adhesion formation and altered localization of the alpha2beta1 integrin from cell-cell to cell-matrix adhesions in breast epithelial cells. Constitutively activated R-Ras(38V) dramatically enhanced focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and p130(Cas) phosphorylation upon collagen stimulation or clustering of the alpha2beta1 integrin, even in the absence of increased ligand binding. Signaling events downstream of R-Ras differed from integrins and K-Ras, since pharmacological inhibition of Src or disruption of actin inhibited integrin-mediated FAK and p130(Cas) phosphorylation, focal adhesion formation, and migration in control and K-Ras(12V)-expressing cells but had minimal effect in cells expressing R-Ras(38V). Therefore, signaling from R-Ras to FAK and p130(Cas) has a component that is Src independent and not through classic integrin signaling pathways and a component that is Src dependent. R-Ras effector domain mutants and pharmacological inhibition suggest a partial role for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), but not Raf, in R-Ras signaling to FAK and p130(Cas). However, PI3K cannot account for the Src-independent pathway, since simultaneous inhibition of both PI3K and Src did not completely block effects of R-Ras on FAK phosphorylation. Our results suggest that R-Ras promotes focal adhesion formation by signaling to FAK and p130(Cas) through a novel mechanism that differs from but synergizes with the alpha2beta1 integrin.},

Here we show that stimulated MCSP recruits tyrosine-phosphorylated p130 cas, an adaptor protein important in tumour cell motility and invasion. MCSP stimulation also results in a pronounced activation and recruitment of the Rho-family GTPase Cdc42. MCSP-induced spreading of melanoma cells is dependent upon active Cdc42, a Cdc42-associated tyrosine kinase (Ack-1) and tyrosine phosphorylation of p130cas. Furthermore, vectors inhibiting Ack-1 or Cdc42 expression and/or function abrogate MCSP-induced tyrosine phosphorylation and recruitment of p130cas. Our findings indicate that MCSP may modify tumour growth or invasion by a unique signal-transduction pathway that links Cdc42 activation to downstream tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequent cytoskeletal reorganization.},

	abstract = {Specificity and modulation of integrin function have important consequences for cellular responses to the extracellular matrix, including differentiation and transformation. The Ras-related GTPase, R-Ras, modulates integrin affinity, but little is known of the signaling pathways and biological functions downstream of R-Ras. Here we show that stable expression of activated R-Ras or the closely related TC21 (R-Ras 2) induced integrin-mediated migration and invasion of breast epithelial cells through collagen and disrupted differentiation into tubule structures, whereas dominant negative R-Ras had opposite effects. These results imply novel roles for R-Ras and TC21 in promoting a transformed phenotype and in the basal migration and polarization of these cells. Importantly, R-Ras induced an increase in cellular adhesion and migration on collagen but not fibronectin, suggesting that R-Ras signals to specific integrins. This was further supported by experiments in which R-Ras enhanced the migration of cells expressing integrin chimeras containing the alpha2, but not the alpha5, cytoplasmic domain. In addition, a transdominant inhibition previously noted only between integrin beta cytoplasmic domains was observed for the alpha2 cytoplasmic domain; alpha2beta1-mediated migration was inhibited by the expression of excess alpha2 but not alpha5 cytoplasmic domain-containing chimeras, suggesting the existence of limiting factors that bind the integrin alpha subunit. Using pharmacological inhibitors, we found that R-Ras induced migration on collagen through a combination of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and protein kinase C, but not MAPK, which is distinct from the other Ras family members, Rac, Cdc42, and N- and K-Ras. Thus, R-Ras communicates with specific integrin alpha cytoplasmic domains through a unique combination of signaling pathways to promote cell migration and invasion.},

Changes in the actin cytoskeleton associated with this switch suggest that the small GTPases Cdc42 and Rac, which regulate actin organization, might modulate motility and invasion. However, the role of Cdc42 and Rac1 in epithelial cells, especially with respect to integrin-mediated events, has not been well characterized. Here we show that activation of Cdc42 and Rac1 disrupts the normal polarization of mammary epithelial cells in a collagenous matrix, and promotes motility and invasion. This motility does not require the activation of PAK, JNK, p70 S6 kinase, or Rho, but instead requires phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI(3)K). Further, direct PI(3)K activation is sufficient to disrupt epithelial polarization and induce cell motility and invasion. PI(3)K inhibition also disrupts actin structures, suggesting that activation of PI(3)K by Cdc42 and Rac1 alters actin organization, leading to increased motility and invasiveness.},

	issn = {0021-9258},
	abstract = {Although there are multiple potential collagen-binding proteins on platelets, the contribution of each to collagen-induced signaling events and platelet activation is unclear. We investigated which early platelet signaling events, if any, could be attributed specifically to the binding of collagen to one of its receptors, the alpha2beta1 integrin. Treatment of platelets with collagen induced a rapid activation of the non-receptor tyrosine kinase, Syk, as measured by an increase in phosphorylation and kinase activity. Collagen also induced the rapid phosphorylation of phospholipase Cgamma2 (PLCgamma2). The phosphorylation of both Syk and PLCgamma2, as well as platelet aggregation, was blocked by an anti-alpha2beta1 integrin monoclonal antibody (P1E6), demonstrating that collagen binding to alpha2beta1 is necessary for signaling. Cross-linking of the alpha2beta1 integrin with stimulatory monoclonal antibody against either the beta1 or alpha2 subunit stimulated the phosphorylation of both Syk and PLCgamma2. However, antibody stimulation was dependent on co-stimulation of the FcgammaII receptor (CD32) since specific F(ab')2 fragments did not induce Syk and PLCgamma2 phosphorylation. Thus, these results suggest that occupancy of alpha2beta1 by collagen is necessary, but that a co-receptor, in addition to alpha2beta1, is required for these collagen-induced signaling events. Moreover, the P1E6 antibody did not inhibit all collagen-induced tyrosine phosphorylation events, demonstrating that collagen also induces phosphorylation events that are independent of the alpha2beta1 integrin. In addition to Syk and PLCgamma2, we identified the FcgammaII receptor (FcgammaRII) as being rapidly phosphorylated in response to collagen stimulation, even in the absence of antibodies. Finally, to determine if Syk activation precedes and directly contributes to the phosphorylation of PLCgamma2, platelets were preincubated with the Syk-selective kinase inhibitor, piceatannol. A concentration of piceatannol that inhibited the phosphorylation and kinase activity of Syk, but had no effect on Src kinase activity, blocked the collagen-induced phosphorylation of PLCgamma2 and also inhibited collagen-induced platelet aggregation. Our results begin to delineate a signaling pathway whereby occupancy of the alpha2beta1 integrin is required, but not sufficient, for collagen-induced activation of Syk and the subsequent phosphorylation of PLCgamma2. These events are necessary for platelet activation and aggregation in response to collagen.},

	abstract = {Cellular interactions with collagen in a model of kidney tubulogenesis were investigated using Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells in an in vitro morphogenetic system. MDCK cells adhered to collagen types I and IV in a Mg(2+)-dependent manner, typical of the alpha 2 beta 1 integrin. Collagen-Sepharose affinity chromatography and immunoblotting demonstrated the presence and collagen binding activity of the alpha 2 beta 1 integrin on MDCK cells. To assess the function of alpha 2 beta 1 integrin, MDCK cells were transfected with a plasmid pRSV alpha 2' which allowed the expression of alpha 2-integrin subunit antisense RNA. Three G418-resistant clones showing reduced adhesion to collagen, stable genomic integration of the antisense construct, decreased alpha 2-integrin subunit mRNA and decreased alpha 2-integrin subunit protein expression were selected for analysis in morphogenetic experiments. MDCK cells and plasmid-only control transfectants, cultured in three-dimensional collagen type I gels, showed normal cyst formation, whereas the antisense RNA transfectants showed increased apoptosis and formed small rudimentary cysts. Stimulation with hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor-containing 3T3 fibroblast-conditioned medium or recombinant hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor resulted in extensive branching of the preformed control cysts whereas the surviving small cysts formed by antisense expressing cells increased in size but failed to elongate and branch upon stimulation. We conclude that alpha 2 beta 1 integrin collagen interactions play a crucial role in the hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor-induced tubulogenesis and branching morphogenesis of MDCK cells in collagen gels as well as an important role in cell survival.},

	abstract = {To begin to determine the role of the alpha 2 beta 1 integrin and its ligands, collagen I, collagen IV, and laminin, in mammary epithelial differentiation in vivo, we determined the expression of these molecules by in situ hybridization and immunofluorescence in the developing mouse mammary gland. Expression of collagen I, collagen IV, and laminin mRNAs in the mammary gland during puberty corresponded to the period of greatest growth of the gland, 4-7 weeks postnatally. Collagen I expression preceded collagen IV expression, both of which preceded laminin expression, suggesting an important temporal sequence of extracellular matrix (ECM) production. When growth of the epithelium ceased in the adult virgin gland, expression of all three mRNAs became undetectable. Following the onset of pregnancy these molecules were re-expressed with the same chronology observed during puberty. Collagen I, collagen IV, and laminin were expressed by stromal cells immediately surrounding the developing ductal epithelium. Surprisingly, we found no expression of ECM components in the epithelial cells, suggesting the mammary epithelium does not synthesize its own basement membrane. The distribution of collagen I was consistent with a role in duct formation, since collagen I was strikingly abundant around larger mammary ducts, but was sparse around growing endbuds or alveoli. Conversely, there was abundant laminin near growing endbuds and around alveoli, and less around large ducts, suggesting its role is different than collagen I. The alpha 2 beta 1 integrin was present on the basal, lateral, and apical surfaces of the mammary epithelium throughout postnatal development and pregnancy. The alpha 2 beta 1 integrin expression was strongest at midpregnancy, suggesting a role for alpha 2 beta 1 integrin in the alveolar formation that occurs at this time. The alpha 2 beta 1 integrin expression decreased dramatically in the lactating gland. Our results suggest that alpha 2 beta 1 integrin interactions with its temporally and spatially regulated ligands, collagen I, collagen IV, and laminin, could play an important role in mammary morphogenesis in vivo.},

To determine more directly the role of the alpha 2 beta 1 integrin, a collagen and laminin receptor, in mediating the collagen-dependent differentiation of mammary cells, we reduced expression of the integrin by the well differentiated human breast carcinoma cell line, T47D, by stably expressing alpha 2 integrin antisense mRNA. Flow cytometry demonstrated that the antisense-expressing clones had levels of alpha 2 beta 1 integrin on their surfaces that were decreased by 30-70\%. Adhesion of antisense-expressing clones to both collagens I and IV was decreased relative to controls in a manner that correlated with the level of cell surface alpha 2 beta 1 integrin expression. Adhesion to fibronectin and laminin were not affected. Motility across collagen-coated filters in haptotaxis assays was increased for only those clones that exhibited intermediate levels of adhesion to collagen, suggesting that an intermediate density of cell-surface alpha 2 beta 1 integrin optimally supports cell motility. When cultured in three-dimensional collagen gels, T47D cells organized in a manner suggestive of a glandular epithelium. In contrast, antisense-expressing clones with decreased alpha 2 beta 1 integrin were not able to organize in three-dimensional collagen gels. The growth rate of T47D cells was reduced when the cells were cultured in three-dimensional collagen gels. Unlike adhesion, motility, and morphogenesis, growth rates were unaffected by reduction of alpha 2 beta 1 integrin expression. Our results suggest that adhesive interactions mediated by a critical level of surface alpha 2 beta 1 integrin expression are key determinants of the collagen-dependent morphogenetic capacity of mammary epithelial cells.},

In this paper, using zebrafish larval tail fins as a model, we find that wounding rapidly activated SFK and calcium signaling in epithelia. The immediate SFK and calcium signaling in epithelia was important for late epimorphic regeneration of amputated fins. Wound-induced activation of SFKs in epithelia was dependent on injury-generated H(2)O(2). A SFK member, Fynb, was responsible for fin regeneration.

Defects in wound repair are associated with human disease including pyoderma gangrenosum, a heterogeneous disorder that is characterized by unhealed wounds and chronic inflammation of unclear etiology.

Recent progress in wound and regenerative biology has been gained by studying genetically tractable model organisms, like zebrafish, that retain the ability to regenerate. The optical transparency and ease of genetic manipulation make zebrafish an ideal model system to dissect multi-cellular and tissue level interactions during wound repair. The focus of this review is on recent advances in understanding how inflammation and wound repair are orchestrated and integrated to achieve wound resolution and tissue regeneration using zebrafish.},

	abstract = {Tissue wounding induces the rapid recruitment of leukocytes. Wounds and tumours--a type of 'unhealed wound'--generate hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) through an NADPH oxidase (NOX). This extracellular H(2)O(2) mediates recruitment of leukocytes, particularly the first responders of innate immunity, neutrophils, to injured tissue. However, the sensor that neutrophils use to detect the redox state at wounds is unknown. Here we identify the Src family kinase (SFK) Lyn as a redox sensor that mediates initial neutrophil recruitment to wounds in zebrafish larvae. Lyn activation in neutrophils is dependent on wound-derived H(2)O(2) after tissue injury, and inhibition of Lyn attenuates neutrophil wound recruitment. Inhibition of SFKs also disrupted H(2)O(2)-mediated chemotaxis of primary human neutrophils. In vitro analysis identified a single cysteine residue, C466, as being responsible for direct oxidation-mediated activation of Lyn. Furthermore, transgenic-tissue-specific reconstitution with wild-type Lyn and a cysteine mutant revealed that Lyn C466 is important for the neutrophil wound response and downstream signalling in vivo. This is the first identification, to our knowledge, of a physiological redox sensor that mediates leukocyte wound attraction in multicellular organisms.},

However, less is known about the molecular composition of the cell rear and how the uropod functions during cell motility. Here, we demonstrate that phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase type Igamma (PIPKIgamma661), which generates PtdIns(4,5)P(2), is enriched in the uropod during chemotaxis of primary neutrophils and differentiated HL-60 cells (dHL-60). Using time-lapse microscopy, we show that enrichment of PIPKIgamma661 at the cell rear occurs early upon chemoattractant stimulation and is persistent during chemotaxis. Accordingly, we were able to detect enrichment of PtdIns(4,5)P(2) at the uropod during chemotaxis. Overexpression of kinase-dead PIPKIgamma661 compromised uropod formation and rear retraction similar to inhibition of ROCK signaling, suggesting that PtdIns(4,5)P(2) synthesis is important to elicit the backness response during chemotaxis. Together, our findings identify a previously unknown function for PIPKIgamma661 as a novel component of the backness signal that regulates rear retraction during chemotaxis.},

The clint1 mutants exhibit chronic inflammation characterized by increased Interleukin 1beta expression, leukocyte infiltration, bidirectional trafficking and phagocytosis of cellular debris. The defects in clint1 mutants can be rescued by expression of zebrafish clint1 and can be phenocopied with clint1-specific morpholinos, supporting an essential role for Clint1 in epidermal development. Interaction studies suggest that Clint1 and Lethal giant larvae 2 function synergistically to regulate epidermal homeostasis. Accordingly, clint1 mutants show impaired hemidesmosome formation, loss of cell-cell contacts and increased motility suggestive of epithelial to mesenchymal transition. Taken together, our findings describe a novel function for the ENTH domain protein Clint1 in epidermal development and inflammation and suggest that its deficiency in zebrafish generates a phenotype that resembles the human condition psoriasis.},

Blocking apoptosis using pan-caspase inhibitors resulted in decreased neutrophil recruitment into the body of the larva, suggesting a causative link between apoptosis and leukocyte infiltration.

In this study, we show that the cytoskeletal protein talin1 is required for TCR-mediated activation of LFA-1 through regulation of LFA-1 affinity and clustering. Depletion of talin1 from human T cells by small interfering RNAs impairs TCR-induced adhesion to ICAM-1 and T cell-APC conjugation. TCR-induced LFA-1 polarization, but not actin polarization, is defective in talin1-deficient T cells. Although LFA-1 affinity is also reduced in talin1-deficient T cells, rescue of LFA-1 affinity alone is not sufficient to restore LFA-1 adhesive function. Together, our findings indicate that TCR-induced up-regulation of LFA-1-dependent adhesiveness and resulting T cell-APC conjugation require talin1.},

	abstract = {Integrin receptors play a central role in cell migration through their roles as adhesive receptors for both other cells and extracellular matrix components. In this study, we demonstrate that integrin and cadherin receptors coordinately regulate contact-mediated inhibition of cell migration. In addition to promoting proliferation (Sastry, S., M. Lakonishok, D. Thomas, J. Muschler, and A. Horwitz. 1996. J. Cell Biol. 133:169-184), ectopic expression of the alpha5 integrin in cultures of primary quail myoblasts promotes a striking contact-mediated inhibition of cell migration. Myoblasts ectopically expressing alpha5 integrin (alpha5 myoblasts) move normally when not in contact, but upon contact, they show inhibition of migration and motile activity (i.e., extension and retraction of membrane protrusions). As a consequence, these cells tend to grow in aggregates and do not migrate to close a wound. This phenotype is also seen with ectopic expression of beta1 integrin, paxillin, or activated FAK (CD2 FAK) and therefore appears to result from enhanced integrin-mediated signaling. The contact inhibition observed in the alpha5 myoblasts is mediated by N-cadherin, whose expression is upregulated more than fivefold. Perturbation studies using low calcium conditions, antibody inhibition, and ectopic expression of wild-type and mutant N-cadherins all implicate N-cadherin in the contact inhibition of migration. Ectopic expression of N-cadherin also produces cells that show inhibited migration upon contact; however, they do not show suppressed motile activity, suggesting that integrins and cadherins coordinately regulate motile activity. These observations have potential importance to normal and pathologic processes during embryonic development and tumor metastasis.},

To determine if fibronectin density modulates eosinophil function, we investigated the effect of fibronectin and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) density on eosinophil migration and signaling via the p38 and extracellular regulated kinase (ERK)-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways. There was a dose-dependent inhibition of eosinophil spreading and migration on increasing concentrations of fibronectin but not VCAM-1. In addition, activation of p38 MAPK was inhibited at high fibronectin but not high VCAM-1 concentrations, and ERK activity was slightly reduced at high VCAM-1 and fibronectin concentrations.

This technique is well suited for use with automated microscope stages leading to decreased imaging time and increased throughput compared to traditional methods.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of this device for a neutrophil migration screening application using larvae 3 days post fertilization (dpf) Tg(mpx:dendra2). Larvae were loaded into ZEBRA devices and treated with a neutrophil attractant (LTB4) or LTB4 with and without a PI3K inhibitor, LY294002.

In this report we have used a series of constructs based on the modular structure of Talin1 to determine the structural elements that specify the subcellular localization of Talin1. We show that the conserved actin-binding I/LWEQ module at the C-terminus of Talin1 is necessary and sufficient for targeting to focal adhesion complexes. We also used truncation and site-directed mutagenesis to demonstrate that this novel targeting function correlates with, but is separable from, the actin-binding properties of the Talin1 I/LWEQ module. In addition, we have shown that focal adhesion targeting, unlike actin binding, is not conserved among I/LWEQ module proteins. Finally, we have demonstrated that the subcellular localization of the Talin1 I/LWEQ module is regulated by an intrasteric interaction with an upstream alpha-helix, suggesting that both the actin binding and adhesion-targeting elements are masked in full-length Talin1. Our results define a novel role for the I/LWEQ module as the primary adhesion-complex targeting determinant of Talin1 and suggest that pathways that can relieve inhibition of I/LWEQ module function will be important for regulating the structural and signaling properties of adhesion complexes.},

The virulence of an attenuated P. aeruginosa strain lacking a functional Type III secretion system was restored upon phagocyte depletion, suggesting that this system influences virulence through its effects on phagocytes. Intravital imaging revealed bacterial interactions with multiple blood cell types. Neutrophils and macrophages rapidly phagocytosed and killed P. aeruginosa, suggesting that both cell types play a role in protection against infection. Intravascular aggregation of erythrocytes and other blood cells with resultant circulatory blockage was observed immediately upon infection, which may be relevant to the pathogenesis of thrombotic complications of human P. aeruginosa infections.

Timely diagnosis is difficult, and screening or prophylactic measures have generally not been successful. Thus, we need a better understanding of early, asymptomatic pathogenesis. Inhaled cryptococci must survive the host immune response, escape the lung, and persist within the bloodstream in order to reach and invade the brain. Here we took advantage of the zebrafish larval infection model to assess the process of cryptococcal infection and disease development sequentially in a single host. Using yeast or spores as infecting particles, we discovered that both cell types survived and replicated intracellularly and that both ultimately established a sustained, low-level fungemia. We propose that the establishment and maintenance of this sustained fungemia is an important stage of disease progression that has been difficult to study in other model systems. Our data suggest that sustained fungemia resulted from a pattern of repeated escape from, and reuptake by, macrophages, but endothelial cells were also seen to play a role as a niche for cryptococcal survival. Circulating yeast collected preferentially in the brain vasculature and eventually invaded the central nervous system (CNS). As suggested previously in a mouse model, we show here that neutrophils can play a valuable role in limiting the sustained fungemia, which can lead to meningoencephalitis. This early stage of pathogenesis-a balanced interaction between cryptococcal cells, macrophages, endothelial cells, and neutrophils-could represent a window for timely detection and intervention strategies for cryptococcal meningoencephalitis.},

The mu- and m-calpains consist of a mu- or m-80-kDa large subunit (genes Capn1 and Capn2), and a common 28-kDa small subunit (Capn4). To assess the role of calpain in migration, we used fibroblasts obtained from Capn4(-/-) mouse embryos. The cells lacked calpain activity on casein zymography and did not generate the characteristic calpain-generated spectrin breakdown product that is observed in wild-type cells. Capn4(-/-) cells had decreased migration rates and abnormal organization of the actin cytoskeleton with a loss of central stress fibers. Interestingly, these cells extended numerous thin projections and displayed delayed retraction of membrane protrusions and filopodia. The number of focal adhesions was decreased in Capn4(-/-) cells, but the cells had prominent vinculin-containing focal complexes at the cell periphery. The levels of the focal adhesion proteins, alpha-actinin, focal adhesion kinase (FAK), spectrin, talin, and vinculin, were the same in Capn4(+/+) and Capn4(-/-) cells. FAK, alpha-actinin, and vinculin were not cleaved in either cell type plated on fibronectin. However, proteolysis of the focal complex component, talin, was detected in the wild-type cells but not in the Capn4(-/-) cells, suggesting that calpain cleavage of talin is important during cell migration. Moreover, talin cleavage was again observed when calpain activity was partially restored in Capn4(-/-) embryonic fibroblasts by stable transfection with a vector expressing the rat 28-kDa calpain small subunit. The results demonstrate unequivocally that calpain is a critical regulator of cell migration and of the organization of the actin cytoskeleton and focal adhesions.},

	abstract = {We previously demonstrated contrasting roles for integrin alpha subunits and their cytoplasmic domains in controlling cell cycle withdrawal and the onset of terminal differentiation (Sastry, S., M. Lakonishok, D. Thomas, J. Muschler, and A.F. Horwitz. 1996. J. Cell Biol. 133:169-184). Ectopic expression of the integrin alpha5 or alpha6A subunit in primary quail myoblasts either decreases or enhances the probability of cell cycle withdrawal, respectively. In this study, we addressed the mechanisms by which changes in integrin alpha subunit ratios regulate this decision. Ectopic expression of truncated alpha5 or alpha6A indicate that the alpha5 cytoplasmic domain is permissive for the proliferative pathway whereas the COOH-terminal 11 amino acids of alpha6A cytoplasmic domain inhibit proliferation and promote differentiation. The alpha5 and alpha6A cytoplasmic domains do not appear to initiate these signals directly, but instead regulate beta1 signaling. Ectopically expressed IL2R-alpha5 or IL2R-alpha6A have no detectable effect on the myoblast phenotype. However, ectopic expression of the beta1A integrin subunit or IL2R-beta1A, autonomously inhibits differentiation and maintains a proliferative state. Perturbing alpha5 or alpha6A ratios also significantly affects activation of beta1 integrin signaling pathways. Ectopic alpha5 expression enhances expression and activation of paxillin as well as mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase with little effect on focal adhesion kinase (FAK). In contrast, ectopic alpha6A expression suppresses FAK and MAP kinase activation with a lesser effect on paxillin. Ectopic expression of wild-type and mutant forms of FAK, paxillin, and MAP/erk kinase (MEK) confirm these correlations. These data demonstrate that (a) proliferative signaling (i.e., inhibition of cell cycle withdrawal and the onset of terminal differentiation) occurs through the beta1A subunit and is modulated by the alpha subunit cytoplasmic domains; (b) perturbing alpha subunit ratios alters paxillin expression and phosphorylation and FAK and MAP kinase activation; (c) quantitative changes in the level of adhesive signaling through integrins and focal adhesion components regulate the decision of myoblasts to withdraw from the cell cycle, in part via MAP kinase.},

	abstract = {Integrin cell surface adhesion receptors play a central role in mediating cell migration. We have developed a model system consisting of CHO cells ectopically expressing the alpha IIb beta 3 integrin to study integrin affinity and cytoskeletal interactions during cell migration. The alpha IIb beta 3 integrins are suited for study of integrin receptors during cell migration because they are well characterized with respect to ligand binding, cytoskeletal interactions, and signal transduction, and mutants with altered receptor function are available. The alpha IIb beta 3 receptor specifically mediates migration of alpha IIb beta 3-transfected CHO cells. The migration of transfected CHO cells was studied on a fibrinogen substrate both by time lapse videomicroscopy and by random and haptotactic transwell assays. Haptotactic and random transwell assays measured distinct aspects of migration, with the random transwell assay correlating most closely with time lapse videomicroscopy. Mutations in the cytoplasmic domains that increase ligand affinity or activation of the alpha IIb beta 3 receptor into a high affinity state by the LIBS6 antibody decreased the migration rate. Likewise, mutations that increase cytoskeletal organization without affecting affinity also decreased the migration rate. In contrast, truncation of the beta chain, which alters cytoskeletal associations as assayed by absence of focal adhesions, decreased haptotactic migration while increasing random migration. These effects on the migration rate were partially compensated for by altering substrate concentration, demonstrating optimum substrate concentrations that supported maximal migration. For example, cells expressing integrins locked in the high affinity state showed maximal migration at lower substrate concentrations than cells expressing low affinity receptor. Together, these results implicate the strength of adhesion between cell and substrate, as modulated by receptor affinity, organization of adhesive complexes, and substrate concentration, as important regulators of cell migration rate. Further, we demonstrate a dominant effect of high affinity integrin in inhibiting migration regardless of the organization of adhesive complexes. These observations have potential implications for tumor metastasis and its therapy.},

We identified a mutant line with an insertion in the Hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor 1 gene (hai1; also known as Spint1) that showed accumulation of neutrophils in the fin. The mutant embryos exhibited inflammation in areas of epidermal hyperproliferation that was rescued by knock-down of the type II transmembrane serine protease Matriptase 1 (also known as St14), suggesting a novel role for Hai1-Matriptase 1 pathway in regulating inflammation. Using time-lapse microscopy of mutant embryos that express GFP from a neutrophil-specific promoter, we found that individual neutrophils in inflamed tissue displayed random motility characterized by periods of pausing alternating with periods of motility. During periods of persistent movement the cells were highly polarized, while the pausing modes were characterized by a loss of cell polarity. In contrast to responses to acute injury, neutrophils did not exhibit clear retrograde chemotaxis or resolution of inflammation in the mutant. These findings illustrate the utility of zebrafish as a new model system to study chronic inflammation and to visualize immune responses with high resolution in vivo.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: T cell activation and immune synapse formation require the appropriate activation and clustering of the integrin, LFA-1. Previous work has reported that the calpain family of calcium-dependent proteases are important regulators of integrin activation and modulate T cell adhesion and migration. However, these studies have been limited by the use of calpain inhibitors, which have known off-target effects.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we used a LoxP/CRE system to specifically deplete calpain 4, a small regulatory calpain subunit required for expression and activity of ubiquitously expressed calpains 1 and 2, in CD4+ T cells. CD4+ and CD8+ T cells developed normally in Capn4(F/F):CD4-CRE mice and had severely diminished expression of Calpain 1 and 2, diminished talin proteolysis and impaired casein degradation. Calpain 4-deficient T cells showed no difference in adhesion or migration on the LFA-1 ligand ICAM-1 compared to control T cells. Moreover, there was no impairment in conjugation between Capn4(F/F):CD4-CRE T cells and antigen presenting cells, and the conjugates were still capable of polarizing LFA-1, PKC-theta and actin to the immune synapse. Furthermore, T cells from Capn4(F/F):CD4-CRE mice showed normal proliferation in response to either anti-CD3/CD28 coated beads or cognate antigen-loaded splenocytes. Finally, there were no differences in the rates of apoptosis following extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic stimuli.
CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings demonstrate that calpain 4 is not necessary for LFA-1-mediated adhesion, conjugation or migration. These results challenge previous reports that implicate a central role for calpains in the regulation of T cell LFA-1 function.},

	abstract = {Natural killer T (NKT) cells are innate-like T cells that recognize specific microbial antigens and also display autoreactivity to self-antigens. The nature of NKT-cell autoreactive activation remains poorly understood. We show here that the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is operative during human NKT-cell autoreactive activation, but calcium signaling is severely impaired. This results in a response that is biased toward granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) secretion because this cytokine requires extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling but is not highly calcium dependent, whereas interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), interleukin (IL)-4, and IL-2 production are minimal. Autoreactive activation was associated with reduced migration velocity but did not induce arrest; thus, NKT cells retained the ability to survey antigen presenting cells (APCs). IL-12 and IL-18 stimulated autoreactively activated NKT cells to secrete IFN-gamma, and this was mediated by Janus kinase-signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK-STAT)-dependent signaling without induction of calcium flux. This pathway did not require concurrent contact with CD1d(+) APCs but was strictly dependent on preceding autoreactive stimulation that induced ERK activation. In contrast, NKT-cell responses to the glycolipid antigen alpha-galactosyl ceramide (alpha-GalCer) were dampened by prior autoreactive activation. These results show that NKT-cell autoreactivity induces restricted cytokine secretion and leads to altered basal activation that potentiates innate responsiveness to costimulatory cytokines while modulating sensitivity to foreign antigens.},

	abstract = {Cell migration requires the regulated and dynamic turnover of adhesive complexes. We have previously demonstrated that the calcium-dependent protease, calpain, regulates the organization of adhesive complexes and cell detachment during cell migration. Evidence is now provided that inhibiting calpain through over-expression of the endogenous inhibitor of calpain, calpastatin, and pharmacological inhibitors results in an inhibition of adhesive complex disassembly with stabilization of GFP-vinculin and GFP/RFP-zyxin at the cell periphery. Calpain was also required for the microtubule-mediated turnover of adhesive complex sites after nocodazole wash-out, suggesting that calpain may mediate focal complex disassembly downstream of microtubules. Using dual imaging of RFP-zyxin and GFP-alpha-actinin, we observed a temporal and spatial relationship between alpha-actinin localization to focal contacts and the subsequent disassembly or translocation of RFP-zyxin containing focal complexes in areas of cell retraction. Calpain inhibition disrupted alpha-actinin localization to zyxin-containing focal contacts and focal complex disassembly or translocation to the cell center. In addition, disrupting alpha-actinin localization to focal complexes through expression of the alpha-actinin rod domain, but not the head domain, resulted in inhibition of focal adhesion disassembly similar to calpain inhibition. Our studies suggest a novel mechanism of action whereby calpain may modulate alpha-actinin localization into focal complexes and their subsequent disassembly or translocation.},

Furthermore, we show that protrusion kinetics of lamellipodia at the leading edge are improperly regulated in Capn4(-/-) cells, leading to impaired net forward lamellipodial extension. To address the isoform specific functions of calpain 1 and calpain 2 during cell protrusion, we stably introduced small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting each isoform into a fibroblast cell line.

Spatiotemporal photolabeling of neutrophils in vivo demonstrates that they emerge from the hematopoietic tissue in close proximity to injured tissue and repeat forward and reverse migration between the wound and the vasculature. Subsequently, neutrophils disperse throughout the body as wound-healing proceeds, contributing to local resolution at injured tissue and systemic dissemination of wound-sensitized neutrophils. Tissue damage also alters the fate of neutrophils in the caudal hematopoietic tissue and promotes caudorostral mobilization of neutrophils via the circulation to the cephalic mesenchyme.

We found that redox-SFK signaling through p22phox and Yes-related kinase is necessary for macrophage wound attraction and the subsequent reverse migration of neutrophils.

Using microfluidics, we show that depletion of Hax1 impairs neutrophil uropod detachment and directed migration. Hax1-deficient cells also display increased integrin-mediated adhesion and reduced RhoA activity. Moreover, depletion of RhoA induces increased neutrophil adhesion and impaired migration, suggesting that Hax1 regulates neutrophil adhesion and chemotaxis through RhoA.

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune arthritis characterized by joint destruction. Anti-citrullinated protein antibodies are pathologic in rheumatoid arthritis, but the role of the citrullinated proteins themselves is much less clear. Citrullination is the conversion of the arginine residues of a protein to citrulline. In the inflamed rheumatoid joint there is increased protein citrullination. Several proteins are citrullinated in rheumatoid arthritis, including collagen type II, fibrinogen, and fibronectin. Fibronectin is thought to mediate the adhesion of joint-invading synovial fibroblasts to the rheumatoid cartilage in addition to regulating other synovial fibroblast functions. However, the effect of citrullinated fibronectin on synovial fibroblasts is unknown.
METHODS: To investigate the effect of citrullinated fibronectin on synovial fibroblast behavior, we cultured normal murine, arthritic murine, and human rheumatoid synovial fibroblasts. We then compared several synovial fibroblast functions in the presence of fibronectin versus citrullinated fibronectin. We assessed adhesion with time-lapse microscopy, migration with transwell assays, focal adhesion kinase and paxillin phosphorylation by western blot, and focal matrix degradation by fluorescent gelatin degradation.
RESULTS: Normal synovial fibroblasts have impaired adhesion, spreading, migration, and integrin-mediated phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase and paxillin on citrullinated fibronectin. Murine arthritic and human rheumatoid synovial fibroblasts also have impaired adhesion and spreading on citrullinated fibronectin, but focal matrix degradation is unaffected by citrullinated fibronectin.
CONCLUSION: Citrullination of fibronectin alters synovial fibroblast behavior and may affect how these cells adhere to and invade the joint and travel through the bloodstream. This work suggests an important role for the interaction of synovial fibroblasts with citrullinated matrix in the pathophysiology of rheumatoid arthritis.},

Autosomal dominant gain-of-function truncations of CXCR4 are associated with warts, hypo-gammaglobulinemia, infections, and myelokathexis (WHIM) syndrome, a primary immunodeficiency disorder characterized by neutropenia and recurrent infections. Recent progress has implicated CXCR4-SDF1 (stromal cell-derived factor 1) signaling in regulating neutrophil homeostasis, but the precise role of CXCR4-SDF1 interactions in regulating neutrophil motility in vivo is not known. Here, we use the optical transparency of zebrafish to visualize neutrophil trafficking in vivo in a zebrafish model of WHIM syndrome. We demonstrate that expression of WHIM mutations in zebrafish neutrophils induces neutrophil retention in hematopoietic tissue, impairing neutrophil motility and wound recruitment. The neutrophil retention signal induced by WHIM truncation mutations is SDF1 dependent, because depletion of SDF1 with the use of morpholino oligonucleotides restores neutrophil chemotaxis to wounds. Moreover, localized activation of a genetically encoded, photoactivatable Rac guanosine triphosphatase is sufficient to direct migration of neutrophils that express the WHIM mutation. The findings suggest that this transgenic zebrafish model of WHIM syndrome may provide a valuable tool to screen for agents that modify CXCR4-SDF1 retention signals.},

Live imaging demonstrated that both neutrophils and macrophages were recruited to localized otic infection with mutant and wild-type S. iniae and were able to phagocytose bacteria. Depletion of neutrophils and macrophages impaired host survival following infection with wild-type S. iniae and the cpsA mutant, suggesting that leukocytes are critical for host survival in the presence of both the wild-type and mutant bacteria. However, zebrafish larvae with impaired neutrophil function but normal macrophage function had increased susceptibility to wild-type bacteria but not the cpsA mutant.

The adaptive immune system is not fully functional until several weeks post fertilization, but zebrafish larvae have a conserved vertebrate innate immune system with both neutrophils and macrophages. Thus, the generation of a larval infection model allows the study of the specific contribution of innate immunity in controlling S. iniae infection. The site of microinjection will determine whether an infection is systemic or initially localized. Here, we present our protocols for otic vesicle injection of zebrafish aged 2-3 days post fertilization as well as our techniques for fluorescent confocal imaging of infection. A localized infection site allows observation of initial microbe invasion, recruitment of host cells and dissemination of infection. Our findings using the zebrafish larval model of S. iniae infection indicate that zebrafish can be used to examine the differing contributions of host neutrophils and macrophages in localized bacterial infections.

In this review, we will highlight the current understanding of the role of neutrophils in pediatric rheumatology, with a focus on juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and lupus.
RECENT FINDINGS: In inflamed tissues, neutrophils extrude neutrophil extracellular traps containing autoantigen that potentially drives lupus and rheumatoid factor-positive JIA. However, the contribution of neutrophil extracellular traps to pathogenesis remains an area of intense investigation. In JIA joints, neutrophils are activated to such an extent that associated circulating levels of S100A proteins may serve as biomarkers, correlating with disease activity, predicting response to treatment and heralding flares. Beyond the effects of 'normal' activation, neutrophils in JIA and lupus display dysregulation in gene expression, subset activation, and apoptosis.
SUMMARY: The role of neutrophils in pediatric rheumatology is an understudied area, but garnering increasing attention. Although clearly implicated in JIA and lupus, the specific contributions of neutrophils to pathogenesis and the use of neutrophil activity surrogates as biomarkers require further study. Clarification of these outstanding issues will have implications for diagnosis and treatment of pediatric rheumatologic conditions.},

In contrast, PI3K signalling is required for neutrophil responses to both wounding and infection. In vivo imaging using a H(2)O(2) probe detects dynamic H(2)O(2) generation at wounds but not at infected tissue.

During infection, E. coli O157:H7 secretes StcE, a metalloprotease that promotes the formation of attaching and effacing lesions and inhibits the complement cascade via cleavage of mucin-type glycoproteins. We found that StcE cleaved the mucin-like, immune cell-restricted glycoproteins CD43 and CD45 on the neutrophil surface and altered neutrophil function. Treatment of human neutrophils with StcE led to increased respiratory burst production and increased cell adhesion. StcE-treated neutrophils exhibited an elongated morphology with defective rear detachment and impaired migration, suggesting that removal of the anti-adhesive capability of CD43 by StcE impairs rear release. Use of zebrafish embryos to model neutrophil migration revealed that StcE induced neutrophil retention in the fin after tissue wounding, suggesting that StcE modulates neutrophil-mediated inflammation in vivo. Neutrophils are crucial innate effectors of the antibacterial immune response and can contribute to severe complications caused by infection with E. coli O157:H7. Our data suggest that the StcE mucinase can play an immunomodulatory role by directly altering neutrophil function during infection. StcE may contribute to inflammation and tissue destruction by mediating inappropriate neutrophil adhesion and activation.},

OBJECTIVE: To describe a 13-year-old girl with overlapping symptoms of NOMID and Muckle-Wells syndrome who has a mutation in cryopyrin (NALP3).
METHODS: We examined neutrophil migration using transwell assay and time-lapse videomicroscopy. We also examined p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation in patient and control neutrophils using Western blot analysis.
RESULTS: Neutrophil defects in chemotactic migration were found to a variety of chemoattractants, including interleukin 8, N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine, complement C5a, and leukotriene B4. Her neutrophils exhibited elevated basal and stimulated p38 MAPK activation in response to interleukin 8, N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine, complement C5a, and leukotriene B4.
CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first, to our knowledge, to demonstrate defects in neutrophil chemotaxis and p38 MAPK signaling in a patient with NOMID and Muckle-Wells syndrome and a cryopyrin mutation.},

These adhesion receptors link to the actin cytoskeleton, transmitting biochemical signals and force during cell migration and interactions with the extracellular matrix. Many integrin-cytoskeleton connections are formed by filamins and talin. The beta7 integrin tail binds strongly to filamin and supports less migration, fibronectin matrix assembly and focal adhesion formation than either the beta1D tail, which binds strongly to talin, or the beta1A tail, which binds modestly to both filamin and talin. To probe the role of filamin binding, we mapped the filamin-binding site of integrin tails and identified amino acid substitutions that led to selective loss of filamin binding to the beta7 tail and gain of filamin binding to the beta1A tail. These changes affected cell migration and membrane protrusions but not fibronectin matrix assembly or focal adhesion formation. Thus, tight filamin binding restricts integrin-dependent cell migration by inhibiting transient membrane protrusion and cell polarization.},

Innate immunity is known to be the predominant host defense against A. fumigatus; however, innate phagocyte responses to A. fumigatus in an intact host and their contributions to host survival remain unclear. Here, we describe a larval zebrafish A. fumigatus infection model amenable to real-time imaging of host-fungal interactions in live animals. Following infection with A. fumigatus, innate phagocyte populations exhibit clear preferences for different fungal morphologies: macrophages rapidly phagocytose conidia and form aggregates around hyphae, while the neutrophil response is dependent upon the presence of hyphae. Depletion of macrophages rendered host larvae susceptible to invasive disease. Moreover, a zebrafish model of human leukocyte adhesion deficiency with impaired neutrophil function also resulted in invasive disease and impaired host survival. In contrast, macrophage-deficient but not neutrophil-deficient larvae exhibited attenuated disease following challenge with a less virulent (ΔlaeA) strain of A. fumigatus, which has defects in secondary metabolite production. Taking these results together, we have established a new vertebrate model for studying innate immune responses to A. fumigatus that reveals distinct roles for neutrophils and macrophages in mediating host defense against IA.},

The dynamics of PI(3)K products PI(3,4,5)P(3)-PI(3,4)P(2) during neutrophil migration were visualized in living zebrafish, revealing that PI(3)K activation at the leading edge is critical for neutrophil motility in intact tissues. A genetically encoded photoactivatable Rac was used to demonstrate that localized activation of Rac is sufficient to direct migration with precise temporal and spatial control in vivo. Similar stimulation of PI(3)K-inhibited cells did not direct migration. Localized Rac activation rescued membrane protrusion but not anteroposterior polarization of F-actin dynamics of PI(3)K-inhibited cells. Uncoupling Rac-mediated protrusion and polarization suggests a paradigm of two-tiered PI(3)K-mediated regulation of cell motility.

Asthma management would benefit from additional tools that establish biomarkers to identify phenotypes of asthma. We present a microfluidic solution that discriminates asthma from allergic rhinitis based on a patient's neutrophil chemotactic function. The handheld diagnostic device sorts neutrophils from whole blood within 5 min, and generates a gradient of chemoattractant in the microchannels by placing a lid with chemoattractant onto the base of the device. This technology was used in a clinical setting to assay 34 asthmatic (n = 23) and nonasthmatic, allergic rhinitis (n = 11) patients to establish domains for asthma diagnosis based on neutrophil chemotaxis. We determined that neutrophils from asthmatic patients migrate significantly more slowly toward the chemoattractant compared with nonasthmatic patients (P = 0.002). Analysis of the receiver operator characteristics of the patient data revealed that using a chemotaxis velocity of 1.55 μm/min for asthma yields a diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of 96\% and 73\%, respectively. This study identifies neutrophil chemotaxis velocity as a potential biomarker for asthma, and we demonstrate a microfluidic technology that was used in a clinical setting to perform these measurements.},

Current methods are limited in their ability to meet the more demanding requirements for clinical applications. Because patient samples have a short lifespan and sometimes a limited volume (e.g. pediatrics), the operational requirements for an efficient chemotaxis assay are increased in the clinical setting. Here we describe a microscale assay platform for gradient generation that overcomes these limitations. Passive fluidic methods are leveraged to provide a reliable microfluidic gradient generation device, operable in only three pipetting steps. In addition, arrayed imaging and advanced cell tracking algorithms enabled a 50-fold increase in throughput over current methods. These methods were employed to aid in the diagnostic evaluation of an infant who presented with severe, recurrent bacterial infections. Analysis of the infant's neutrophils revealed impaired cell polarization and chemotaxis in a gradient of the chemoattractant fMLP. The patient was subsequently diagnosed with an inhibitory mutation in the Rho GTPase, Rac2. The approach also enabled a microenvironmental screen of human primary neutrophil chemotaxis on fibronectin, fibrinogen and laminin with results suggesting that fibronectin, although commonly used, may not be the most appropriate matrix protein for chemotaxis assays. Together, these findings demonstrate the use of arrayed micro-devices to aid in the diagnosis of a primary immunodeficiency disorder, and illustrate the capability for increased throughput microenvironmental studies and screening targeted to specific human diseases.},

Antigen receptor stimulation induces HS1 phosphorylation, and HS1 is essential for T cell activation. HS1 is also expressed in neutrophils; however, the function of HS1 in neutrophils is not known. Here we show that HS1 localizes to the neutrophil leading edge, and is phosphorylated in response to the chemoattractant formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP) in adherent cells. Using live imaging in microchannels, we show that depletion of endogenous HS1 in the neutrophil-like PLB-985 cell line impairs chemotaxis. We also find that HS1 is necessary for chemoattractant-induced activation of Rac GTPase signaling and Vav1 phosphorylation, suggesting that HS1-mediated Rac activation is necessary for efficient neutrophil chemotaxis. We identify specific phosphorylation sites that mediate HS1-dependent neutrophil motility. Expression of HS1 Y378F, Y397F is sufficient to rescue migration of HS1-deficient neutrophils, however, a triple phospho-mutant Y222F, Y378F, Y397F did not rescue migration of HS1-deficient neutrophils. Moreover, HS1 phosphorylation on Y222, Y378, and Y397 regulates its interaction with Arp2/3.

	abstract = {Microfluidic cell-based systems have enabled the study of cellular phenomena with improved spatiotemporal control of the microenvironment and at increased throughput. While poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) has emerged as the most popular material in microfluidics research, it has specific limitations that prevent microfluidic platforms from achieving their full potential. We present here a complete process, ranging from mold design to embossing and bonding, that describes the fabrication of polystyrene (PS) microfluidic devices with similar cost and time expenditures as PDMS-based devices. Emphasis was placed on creating methods that can compete with PDMS fabrication methods in terms of robustness, complexity, and time requirements. To achieve this goal, several improvements were made to remove critical bottlenecks in existing PS embossing methods. First, traditional lithographic techniques were adapted to fabricate bulk epoxy molds capable of resisting high temperatures and pressures. Second, a method was developed to emboss through-holes in a PS layer, enabling creation of large arrays of independent microfluidic systems on a single device without need to manually create access ports. Third, thermal bonding of PS layers was optimized in order to achieve quality bonding over large arrays of microsystems. The choice of materials and methods was validated for biological function in two different cell-based applications to demonstrate the versatility of our streamlined fabrication process.},

	abstract = {The secondary metabolome provides pathogenic fungi with a plethoric and versatile panel of molecules that can be deployed during host ingress. While powerful genetic and analytical chemistry methods have been developed to identify fungal secondary metabolites (SMs), discovering the biological activity of SMs remains an elusive yet critical task. Here, we describe a process for identifying the immunosuppressive properties of Aspergillus SMs developed by coupling a cost-effective microfluidic neutrophil chemotaxis assay with an in vivo zebrafish assay. The microfluidic platform allows the identification of metabolites inhibiting neutrophil recruitment with as little as several nano-grams of compound in microliters of fluid. The zebrafish assay demonstrates a simple and accessible approach for performing in vivo studies without requiring any manipulation of the fish. Using this methodology we identify the immunosuppressive properties of a fungal SM, endocrocin. We find that endocrocin is localized in Aspergillus fumigatus spores and its biosynthesis is temperature-dependent. Finally, using the Drosophila toll deficient model, we find that deletion of encA, encoding the polyketide synthase required for endocrocin production, yields a less pathogenic strain of A. fumigatus when spores are harvested from endocrocin permissive but not when harvested from endocrocin restrictive conditions. The tools developed here will open new "function-omic" avenues downstream of the metabolomics, identification, and purification phases.},

METHODS: Cytokine profiles were obtained and compared with patients with atopic disease during the acute presentation and after treatment with low-dose prednisone.
RESULTS: The patient's serum showed elevation of transforming growth factor beta1 and interleukin-5, which improved after treatment with low-dose prednisone.
CONCLUSIONS: The case suggests that patients with EF have cytokine abnormalities similar to atopic patients, but with a striking elevation of transforming growth factor beta1. The responsiveness of the clinical symptoms and cytokine profile to low dose prednisone supports treatment with low dose immunosuppressive therapy in this disorder.},

We investigated the role of the calcium-dependent protease calpain during neutrophil chemotaxis and found that calpain inhibition induced neutrophil adhesion, polarization, and rapid chemokinesis in the absence of exogenous activators. Resting neutrophils display constitutive calpain activity with mu-calpain being the predominant active isoform. Our findings suggest that constitutive calpain activity in resting neutrophils may function as a negative regulator of protrusion and migration. Specific inhibition of mu-calpain, but not m-calpain, induced neutrophil polarization and chemokinesis. In contrast to IL-8-induced chemokinesis, the chemokinesis induced by calpain inhibition was not reduced in the presence of pertussis toxin, suggesting that calpain functions downstream of G protein-coupled receptors. Further, both calpain inhibition and stimulation with IL-8 and formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP) induced an increase in Cdc42 and Rac activation. These findings are consistent with the involvement of calpain in chemotaxis pathways. Accordingly, calpain inhibition decreased neutrophil chemotaxis and directional persistence in a gradient of IL-8 and fMLP. Together, these data reveal a previously uncharacterized function for calpain in neutrophils and suggest that localized modulation of calpain activity may regulate neutrophil chemotaxis downstream of G-protein-coupled receptors.},

	doi = {10.1002/art.38393},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4) is a citrullinating enzyme that has multiple associations with inflammation. In rheumatoid arthritis, PAD4 and protein citrullination are increased in inflamed joints, and anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs) form against citrullinated antigens are formed. ACPA immune complexes can deposit in the joint and induce the production of tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), a critical inflammatory cytokine in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis. Further, in other settings, TNFα has been shown to induce PAD4 activity and modulate antibody formation. We undertook this study to investigate whether TNFα and PAD4 may synergistically exacerbate autoantibody production and inflammatory arthritis.
METHODS: To determine whether TNFα and PAD4 augment autoantibody production and inflammatory arthritis, we first used a multiplex assay to determine whether mice with chronic inflammatory arthritis due to overexpression of TNFα develop autoantibodies against native and citrullinated antigens. With TNF(+) PAD4(+/+) and TNF(+) PAD4(-/-) mice, we then compared serum autoantibody levels by multiplex array, lymphocyte activation by flow cytometry, total serum IgG levels by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, arthritis by clinical and histologic scoring, and systemic inflammation using microfluidic devices.
RESULTS: TNFα-overexpressing mice had increased levels of autoantibodies reactive against native and citrullinated antigens. PAD4(-/-) mice with TNFα-induced arthritis had lower levels of autoantibodies reactive against native and citrullinated antigens, decreased T cell activation and total IgG levels, and reduced inflammation and arthritis compared to PAD4(+/+) TNFα-overexpressing mice.
CONCLUSION: PAD4 mediates autoantibody production and inflammatory arthritis downstream of TNFα.},

Considering the resilience of Candida biofilms to host defenses, we examined the neutrophil response to C. albicans during biofilm growth. In contrast to planktonic C. albicans, biofilms triggered negligible release of NETs. Time lapse imaging confirmed the impairment in NET release and revealed neutrophils adhering to hyphae and migrating on the biofilm. NET inhibition depended on an intact extracellular biofilm matrix as physical or genetic disruption of this component resulted in NET release. Biofilm inhibition of NETosis could not be overcome by protein kinase C activation via phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and was associated with suppression of neutrophil reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The degree of impaired NET release correlated with resistance to neutrophil attack. The clinical relevance of the role for extracellular matrix in diminishing NET production was corroborated in vivo using a rat catheter model. The C. albicans pmr1Δ/Δ, defective in production of matrix mannan, appeared to elicit a greater abundance of NETs by scanning electron microscopy imaging, which correlated with a decreased fungal burden. Together, these findings show that C. albicans biofilms impair neutrophil response through an inhibitory pathway induced by the extracellular matrix.},

	abstract = {One mission of the Microbial Observatory Experiments on the International Space Station (ISS) is to examine the traits and diversity of fungal isolates to gain a better understanding of how fungi may adapt to microgravity environments and how this may affect interactions with humans in a closed habitat. Here, we report an initial characterization of two isolates, ISSFT-021 and IF1SW-F4, of Aspergillus fumigatus collected from the ISS and a comparison to the experimentally established clinical isolates Af293 and CEA10. Whole-genome sequencing of ISSFT-021 and IF1SW-F4 showed 54,960 and 52,129 single nucleotide polymorphisms, respectively, compared to Af293, which is consistent with observed genetic heterogeneity among sequenced A. fumigatus isolates from diverse clinical and environmental sources. Assessment of in vitro growth characteristics, secondary metabolite production, and susceptibility to chemical stresses revealed no outstanding differences between ISS and clinical strains that would suggest special adaptation to life aboard the ISS. Virulence assessment in a neutrophil-deficient larval zebrafish model of invasive aspergillosis revealed that both ISSFT-021 and IF1SW-F4 were significantly more lethal than Af293 and CEA10. Taken together, these genomic, in vitro, and in vivo analyses of two A. fumigatus strains isolated from the ISS provide a benchmark for future investigations of these strains and for continuing research on specific microbial isolates from manned space environments. IMPORTANCE As durations of manned space missions increase, it is imperative to understand the long-term consequence of microbial exposure on human health in a closed human habitat. To date, studies aimed at bacterial and fungal contamination of space vessels have highlighted species compositions biased toward hardy, persistent organisms capable of withstanding harsh conditions. In the current study, we assessed traits of two independent Aspergillus fumigatus strains isolated from the International Space Station. Ubiquitously found in terrestrial soil and atmospheric environments, A. fumigatus is a significant opportunistic fungal threat to human health, particularly among the immunocompromised. Using two well-known clinical isolates of A. fumigatus as comparators, we found that both ISS isolates exhibited normal in vitro growth and chemical stress tolerance yet caused higher lethality in a vertebrate model of invasive disease. These findings substantiate the need for additional studies of physical traits and biological activities of microbes adapted to microgravity and other extreme extraterrestrial conditions.},

In addition to their unique morphology and antimicrobial activity, neutrophils are characterized by the ability to migrate rapidly up shallow gradients of attractants in vivo. The directed migration of neutrophils, referred to as chemotaxis, requires the temporal and spatial regulation of intracellular signaling pathways allowing the neutrophil to detect a gradient of attractant, polarize, and migrate rapidly toward the highest concentration of the chemoattractant. A challenge to understanding neutrophil chemotaxis is the inherent difficulty encountered when working with primary neutrophils, which are difficult to purify in the resting state, are not easily transfected, are terminally differentiated, and have a short life span after purification. Here we discuss neutrophil purification methods and chemotaxis assays and provide methodology for working with a neutrophil-like cell line, the HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cell line.

	abstract = {Heat shock is a routine method used for inducible gene expression in animal models including zebrafish. Environmental temperature plays an important role in the immune system and infection progression of ectotherms. In this study, we analyzed the impact of short-term heat shock on neutrophil function using zebrafish (Danio rerio) as an animal model. Short-term heat shock decreased neutrophil recruitment to localized Streptococcus iniae infection and tail fin wounding. Heat shock also increased random neutrophil motility transiently and increased the number of circulating neutrophils. With the use of the translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) method for RNA isolation from specific cell types such as neutrophils, macrophages and epithelial cells, we found that heat shock induced the immediate expression of heat shock protein 70 (hsp70) and a prolonged expression of heat shock protein 27 (hsp27). Heat shock also induced cell stress as detected by the splicing of X-box binding protein 1 (xbp1) mRNA, a marker for endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Exogenous expression of Hsp70, Hsp27 and spliced Xbp1 in neutrophils or epithelial cells did not reproduce the heat shock induced effects on neutrophil recruitment. The effect of heat shock on neutrophils is likely due to a combination of complex changes, including, but not limited to changes in gene expression. Our results indicate that routine heat shock can alter neutrophil function in zebrafish. The findings suggest that caution should be taken when employing a heat shock-dependent inducible system to study the innate immune response.},

We have developed an in vivo system to probe and quantify gene expression changes specifically in transformed cells from chimeric zebrafish expressing oncogenic HRas(V12) using translating ribosomal affinity purification (TRAP). We found that the expression of genes associated with EMT, including slug, vimentin and mmp9, are enriched in HRas(V12) transformed epithelial cells and that this enrichment requires the presence of neutrophils. An early signal induced by HRas(V12) in epithelial cells is the expression of il-8 (cxcl8) and we found that the chemokine receptor, Cxcr2, mediates neutrophil but not macrophage recruitment to the transformed cells. Surprisingly, we also found a cell autonomous role for Cxcr2 signaling in transformed cells for both neutrophil recruitment and EMT related gene expression associated with Ras transformation.

Here, we show that primary neutrophils and neutrophil-like HL-60 cells express both calpain 1 and calpain 2 and that chemoattractants induce the asymmetric recruitment of calpain 2, but not calpain 1, to the leading edge of polarized neutrophils and differentiated HL-60 cells. Using time-lapse microscopy, we show that enrichment of calpain 2 at the leading edge occurs during early pseudopod formation and that its localization is sensitive to changes in the chemotactic gradient. We demonstrate that calpain 2 is recruited to lipid rafts and that cholesterol depletion perturbs calpain 2 localization, suggesting that its enrichment at the front requires proper membrane organization. Finally, we show that catalytic activity of calpain is required to limit pseudopod formation in the direction of chemoattractant and for efficient chemotaxis. Together, our findings identify calpain 2 as a novel component of the frontness signal that promotes polarization during chemotaxis.},

We report a microfluidic technology that enables neutrophil purification and chemotaxis on-chip within minutes, using nanoliters of whole blood, and only requires a micropipette to operate. The low sample volume requirements and novel lid-based method for initiating the gradient of chemoattractant enabled the measurement of human neutrophil migration on a cell monolayer to probe the adherent and migratory states of neutrophils under inflammatory conditions; mouse neutrophil chemotaxis without sacrificing the animal; and both 2D and 3D neutrophil chemotaxis. First, the neutrophil chemotaxis on endothelial cells revealed 2 distinct neutrophil phenotypes, showing that endothelial cell-neutrophil interactions influence neutrophil chemotactic behavior. Second, we validated the mouse neutrophil chemotaxis assay by comparing the adhesion and chemotaxis of neutrophils from chronically inflamed and wild-type mice; we observed significantly higher neutrophil adhesion in blood obtained from chronically inflamed mice. Third, we show that 2D and 3D neutrophil chemotaxis can be directly compared using our technique. These methods allow for new avenues of research while reducing the complexity, time, and sample volume requirements to perform neutrophil chemotaxis assays.},

Using zebrafish larvae, we examined the cellular immune responses to inflammasome activation during infection. We compared the host responses with two Listeria monocytogenes strains: wild type and Lm-pyro, a strain engineered to activate the inflammasome via ectopic expression of flagellin. Infection with Lm-pyro led to activation of the inflammasome, macrophage pyroptosis and ultimately attenuation of virulence. Depletion of caspase A, the zebrafish caspase-1 homolog, restored Lm-pyro virulence. Inflammasome activation specifically recruited macrophages to infection sites, whereas neutrophils were equally recruited to wild type and Lm-pyro infections. Similar to caspase A depletion, macrophage deficiency rescued Lm-pyro virulence to wild-type levels, while defective neutrophils had no specific effect. Neutrophils were, however, important for general clearance of L. monocytogenes, as both wild type and Lm-pyro were more virulent in larvae with defective neutrophils. This study characterizes a novel model for inflammasome studies in an intact host, establishes the importance of macrophages during inflammasome responses and adds importance to the role of neutrophils in controlling L. monocytogenes infections.},

	abstract = {As mediators of innate immunity, neutrophils respond to chemoattractants by adopting a highly polarized morphology. Efficient chemotaxis requires the formation of one prominent pseudopod at the cell front characterized by actin polymerization, while local inhibition suppresses the formation of rear and lateral protrusions. This asymmetric control of signaling pathways is required for directional migration along a chemotactic gradient. Here, we identify the MAGUK protein p55/MPP1 as a mediator of the frontness signal required for neutrophil polarization. We developed a p55 knockout (p55(-/-)) mouse model, and demonstrate that p55(-/-) neutrophils form multiple transient pseudopods upon chemotactic stimulation, and do not migrate efficiently in vitro. Upon agonist stimulation, p55 is rapidly recruited to the leading edge of neutrophils in mice and humans. Total F-actin polymerization, along with Rac1 and RhoA activation, appear to be normal in p55(-/-) neutrophils. Importantly, phosphorylation of Akt is significantly decreased in p55(-/-) neutrophils upon chemotactic stimulation. The activity of immunoprecipitated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase gamma (PI3Kgamma), responsible for chemoattractant-induced synthesis of PIP(3) and Akt phosphorylation, is unperturbed in p55(-/-) neutrophils. Although the total amount of PIP(3) is normal in p55(-/-) neutrophils, PIP(3) is diffusely localized and forms punctate aggregates in activated p55(-/-) neutrophils, as compared to its accumulation at the leading edge membrane in the wild type neutrophils. Together, these results show that p55 is required for neutrophil polarization by regulating Akt phosphorylation through a mechanism that is independent of PI3Kgamma activity.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) are lipids that bind G-protein coupled receptors and differentially promote transmigration of endothelial cells.
OBJECTIVE: To determine if endothelial cell transmigration stimulated by LPA, not S1P, is dependent on the extracellular matrix.
METHODS: Bovine pulmonary artery (BPAE) endothelial cell transmigration and locomotion were measured using a modified-Boyden chamber and video microscopy, respectively. Results were related to strength of adhesion and characteristics of cell adhesive contacts.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: BPAEs responded to LPA by transmigration through gelatin- or collagen-coated filters, but not through fibronectin-, vitronectin-, or fibrinogen-coated filters. Fewer cells adhered to collagen or gelatin than to fibronectin in a static cell adhesion assay or after application of a g-force to detach cells. Video microscopy revealed that S1P stimulates large lamellipodia on two-dimensional fibronectin substrate. LPA stimulated lamellipodia on fibronectin, but the trailing edge remained attached, resulting in sting ray-shaped cells in video microscopy. LPA-treated cells on gelatin released the trailing edge. To understand how the extracellular matrix may regulate endothelial cell shape during movement, we surveyed changes in focal adhesion proteins. More Hic-5, a paxillin homolog, was detected in the detergent insoluble fraction of BPAEs attached to gelatin than fibronectin. No such difference was found in paxillin. In BPAEs, Hic-5 was localized to smaller punctate structures on fibronectin and longer, thinner focal adhesions on gelatin. These results indicated that localization of Hic-5 and strength of adhesion correlate with endothelial cell transmigration stimulated by LPA, but not with transmigration stimulated by S1P.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Synovial fibroblasts invade cartilage and bone, leading to joint destruction in rheumatoid arthritis. However, the mechanisms that regulate synovial fibroblast invasion are not well understood. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) has been implicated in cellular invasion in several cell types, and FAK inhibitors are in clinical trials for cancer treatment. Little is known about the role of FAK in inflammatory arthritis, but, given its expression in synovial tissue, its known role in invasion in other cells and the potential clinical availability of FAK inhibitors, it is important to determine if FAK contributes to synovial fibroblast invasion and inflammatory arthritis.
METHODS: After treatment with FAK inhibitors, invasiveness of human rheumatoid synovial fibroblasts was determined with Matrigel invasion chambers. Migration and focal matrix degradation, two components of cellular invasion, were assessed in FAK-inhibited rheumatoid synovial fibroblasts by transwell assay and microscopic examination of fluorescent gelatin degradation, respectively. Using mice with tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα)-induced arthritis in which fak could be inducibly deleted, invasion and migration by FAK-deficient murine arthritic synovial fibroblasts were determined as described above and arthritis was clinically and pathologically scored in FAK-deficient mice.
RESULTS: Inhibition of FAK in human rheumatoid synovial fibroblasts impaired cellular invasion and migration. Focal matrix degradation occurred both centrally and at focal adhesions, the latter being a novel site for matrix degradation in synovial fibroblasts, but degradation was unaltered with FAK inhibitors. Loss of FAK reduced invasion in murine arthritic synovial fibroblasts, but not migration or TNFα-induced arthritis severity and joint erosions.
CONCLUSIONS: FAK inhibitors reduce synovial fibroblast invasion and migration, but synovial fibroblast migration and TNFα-induced arthritis do not rely on FAK itself. Thus, inhibition of FAK alone is unlikely to be sufficient to treat inflammatory arthritis, but current drugs that inhibit FAK may inhibit multiple factors, which could increase their efficacy in rheumatoid arthritis.},

The adenosine receptor A2b is expressed in the vascular endothelium before HSPC emergence.

Knockdown of A2b adenosine receptor disrupted scl(+) hemogenic vascular endothelium and the subsequent EHT process. A2b adenosine receptor activation induced CXCL8 via cAMP-protein kinase A (PKA) and mediated hematopoiesis.

Rac-family Rho GTPases are implicated in leukocyte function; however, the distinct roles of different Rac isoforms in host defense in vivo have remained unclear. In this study, we generated Rac2-deficient zebrafish using transcription activator-like effector nucleases to directly compare the role of Rac2 in vivo in neutrophils and macrophages in motility and the response to infection. This zebrafish larval model is highly amenable to live imaging of leukocyte behavior, and we report that in rac2(-/-) larvae both neutrophils and macrophages are defective in basic motility, leading to impaired responses to localized wounds or infections. rac2(-/-) larvae are highly susceptible to infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which can be almost fully rescued by ectopic expression of either Rac2 or Rac1 specifically in neutrophils, indicating that these isoforms have partially overlapping functions in vivo. Rescue of Rac2 expression specifically in macrophages also confers resistance to Pseudomonas infection, highlighting an important role for Rac2 in this leukocyte population as well. Surprisingly, in contrast to neutrophils expressing a Rac2 dominant inhibitory human disease mutation, rac2(-/-) neutrophils do not have altered polarity or mobilization from hematopoietic tissue, suggesting that a different Rac isoform, such as Rac1, also contributes to these phenotypes in vivo.},

This highly organized assembly has been implicated in mucus retention and in the mechanical structure of mucosal surfaces, however the mechanisms that regulate actin microridges remain largely unknown. Here we characterize the composition and dynamics of actin microridges on the surface of zebrafish larvae using live imaging. Microridges contain phospho-tyrosine, cortactin and VASP, but not focal adhesion kinase. Time-lapse imaging reveals dynamic changes in the length and branching of microridges in intact animals. Transient perturbation of the microridge pattern occurs before cell division with rapid re-assembly during and after cytokinesis. Microridge assembly is maintained with constitutive activation of Rho or inhibition of myosin II activity. However, expression of dominant negative RhoA or Rac alters microridge organization, with an increase in distance between microridges. Latrunculin A treatment and photoconversion experiments suggest that the F-actin filaments are actively treadmilling in microridges. Accordingly, inhibition of Arp2/3 or PI3K signaling impairs microridge structure and length. Taken together, actin microridges in zebrafish represent a tractable in vivo model to probe pattern formation and dissect Arp2/3-mediated actin dynamics in vivo.},

The formation of stable T cell-APC contacts depends on the activation of the integrin LFA-1 (CD11aCD18). Several positive regulators of LFA-1 activation downstream of proximal TCR signaling have been identified, including talin; however, negative regulators of LFA-1 activity remain largely unexplored. Extended isoform of phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase type I γ (PIPKIγ90) is a member of the type I phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase family that has been shown previously to modulate talin activation of integrins through production of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and direct binding to talin. In this study, we show that PIPKIγ90 negatively regulates LFA-1-mediated adhesion and activation of T cells. Using CD4(+) T cells from PIPKIγ90-deficient mice, we show that CD4(+) T cells exhibit increased LFA-1-dependent adhesion to ICAM-1 and increased rates of T cell-APC conjugate formation with enhanced LFA-1 polarization at the synapse. In addition to increased adhesiveness, PIPKIγ90-deficient T cells exhibit increased proliferation both in vitro and in vivo and increased production of IFN-γ and IL-2. Together, these results demonstrate that PIPKIγ90 is a negative regulator of Ag-induced T cell adhesion and activation.},

Here we report a simple yet innovative microfluidic device for studying cell migration in the presence of dual chemotactic gradients through a 3-dimensional substrate. The device is tested and validated by studying the migration of the neutrophil-like cell line PLB-985 to gradients of fMLP. Furthermore, the device is expanded and used with heparinised whole blood, whereupon neutrophils were observed to migrate from whole blood towards gradients of fMLP eliminating the need for any neutrophil purification or capture steps.},

Proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), are increased in the airway of patients with severe asthma and have been implicated in the recruitment of neutrophils into areas of inflammation. Here, we show that TNF-alpha induces a stop signal that promotes firm neutrophil adhesion and inhibits neutrophil polarization and chemotaxis to chemoattractants including interleukin-8 and C5a. TNF-alpha treatment of neutrophils plated on a fibrinogen-coated surface promotes firm neutrophil adhesion and the formation of vinculin-containing focal complexes. TNF-alpha induces a more than tenfold increase in p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) but not extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation. Inhibition of p38 MAPK in neutrophils treated with TNF-alpha causes neutrophil polarization and motility. These findings suggest that TNF-alpha initiates a stop signal through a p38 MAPK pathway, which may promote the retention of neutrophils in inflammatory sites. Together, our data suggest that inhibition of p38 MAPK may be an attractive target to limit inflammatory responses that are mediated by TNF-alpha.},

However, the mechanism by which PSTPIP1 regulates the actin cytoskeleton and contributes to disease pathogenesis remains elusive. Here, we show that endogenous PSTPIP1 negatively regulates macrophage podosome organization and matrix degradation. We identify a novel PSTPIP1-R405C mutation in a patient presenting with aggressive pyoderma gangrenosum. Identification of this mutation reveals that PSTPIP1 regulates the balance of podosomes and filopodia in macrophages. The PSTPIP1-R405C mutation is in the SRC homology 3 (SH3) domain and impairs Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) binding, but it does not affect interaction with protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP)-PEST. Accordingly, WASP inhibition reverses the elevated F-actin content, filopodia formation, and matrix degradation induced by PSTPIP1-R405C. Our results uncover a novel role for PSTPIP1 and WASP in orchestrating different types of actin-based protrusions. Our findings implicate the cytoskeletal regulatory functions of PSTPIP1 in the pathogenesis of pyoderma gangrenosum and suggest that the cytoskeleton is a rational target for therapeutic intervention in autoinflammatory disease.},

Calpain-deficient breast cancer cells show impaired invadopodia formation that is rescued by expression of a truncated fragment of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) corresponding to the calpain proteolytic fragment, which indicates that calpain modulates invadopodia through PTP1B. Moreover, PTP1B activity is required for efficient invadopodia formation and breast cancer invasion, which suggests that PTP1B may modulate breast cancer progression through its effects on invadopodia.

We show that depletion of FAK induces the formation of active invadopodia but impairs invasive cell migration. FAK-deficient MTLn3 breast cancer cells display enhanced assembly and dynamics of invadopodia that are rescued by expression of wild-type FAK but not by FAK that cannot be phosphorylated at tyrosine 397.

Our understanding of how calpains are activated and regulated during cell migration has increased as studies have identified roles for calcium and phospholipid binding, autolysis, phosphorylation and inhibition by calpastatin in the modulation of calpain activity. Knockout and knockdown approaches have also contributed significantly to our knowledge of calpain biology, particularly with respect to the specific functions of different calpain isoforms. The mechanisms by which calpain-mediated proteolysis of individual substrates contributes to cell motility have begun to be addressed, and these efforts have revealed roles for proteolysis of specific substrates in integrin activation, adhesion complex turnover and membrane protrusion dynamics.

	abstract = {Cell migration involves the dynamic formation and release of cell-substrate adhesions, where the exertion and detection of mechanical forces take place. Members of the calpain family of calcium-dependent proteases are believed to have a central role in these processes, possibly through the regulation of focal adhesion dynamics. The ubiquitous calpains, calpain 1 (mu-calpain) and calpain 2 (m-calpain), are heterodimers consisting of large catalytic subunits encoded by the Capn1 and Capn2 genes, respectively, and the small regulatory subunit encoded by Capn4. We have examined the role of the calpain regulatory small subunit in traction force production and mechanosensing during cell migration. Capn4-deficient or rescued cells were plated on flexible polyacrylamide substrates, for both the detection of traction forces and the application of mechanical stimuli. The total force output of Capn4-deficient cells was approximately 75\% lower than that of rescued cells and the forces were more randomly distributed and less dynamic in Capn4-deficient cells than in rescued cells. Furthermore, Capn4-deficient cells were less adhesive than wild-type cells and they also failed to respond to mechanical stimulations by pushing or pulling the flexible substrate, or by engaging dorsal receptors to the extracellular matrix. Surprisingly, fibroblasts deficient in calpain 1 or calpain 2 upon siRNA-mediated knockdown of Capn1 or Capn2, respectively, did not show the same defects in force production or adhesion, although they also failed to respond to mechanical stimulation. Interestingly, stress fibers were aberrant and also contained fewer colocalised vinculin-containing adhesions in Capn4-deficient cells than Capn1- and Capn2-knockdown cells. Together, these results suggest that the calpain small subunit plays an important role in the production of mechanical forces and in mediating mechanosensing during fibroblast migration. Furthermore, the Capn4 gene product might perform functions secondary to, or independent of, its role as a regulatory subunit for calpain 1 and calpain 2.},

One potential candidate substrate is the actin binding protein cortactin. Cortactin is a Src substrate that drives actin polymerization by activating the Arp2/3 complex and also stabilizes the cortical actin network. We now provide evidence that proteolysis of cortactin by calpain 2 regulates membrane protrusion dynamics during cell migration. We show that cortactin is a calpain 2 substrate in fibroblasts and that the preferred cleavage site occurs in a region between the actin binding repeats and the alpha-helical domain. We have generated a mutant cortactin that is resistant to calpain proteolysis but retains other biochemical properties of cortactin. Expression of the calpain-resistant cortactin, but not wild-type cortactin, impairs cell migration and increases transient membrane protrusion, suggesting that calpain proteolysis of cortactin limits membrane protrusions and regulates migration in fibroblasts. Furthermore, the enhanced protrusion observed with the calpain-resistant cortactin requires both the Arp2/3 binding site and the Src homology 3 domain of cortactin.

The calpain-generated proteolytic fragment, like paxillin delta, functions as a paxillin antagonist and impairs focal adhesion disassembly and migration. We generated mutant paxillin with a point mutation (S95G) that renders it partially resistant to calpain proteolysis. Paxillin-deficient cells that express paxillin S95G display increased turnover of zyxin-containing adhesions using time-lapse microscopy and also show increased migration. Moreover, cancer-associated somatic mutations in paxillin are common in the N-terminal region between the LD1 and LD2 motifs and confer partial calpain resistance. Taken together, these findings suggest a novel role for calpain-mediated proteolysis of paxillin as a negative regulator of focal adhesion dynamics and migration that may function to limit cancer cell invasion.},

In this study we demonstrate novel functions for RACK1 in regulating adhesion dynamics during cell migration. We report that cells lacking RACK1 are less motile and show reduced dynamics of paxillin and talin at focal complexes. To investigate the role of the RACK1/Src interactions in adhesion dynamics, we used RACK1 in which the putative Src binding site has been mutated (RACK Y246F). RACK1-deficient cells showed enhanced c-Src activity that was rescued by expression of wild type RACK1, but not by RACK Y246F. Expression of wild type RACK1, but not RACK Y246F, was also able to rescue the adhesion and migration defects observed in the RACK1-deficient cells. Furthermore, our findings indicate that RACK1 functions to regulate paxillin phosphorylation and that its effects on paxillin dynamics require the Src-mediated phosphorylation of tyrosine 31/118 on paxillin. Taken together, these findings support a novel role for RACK1 as a key regulator of cell migration and adhesion dynamics through the regulation of Src activity, and the modulation of paxillin phosphorylation at early adhesions.},

The focus of the current review is to summarize recent findings implicating calpains in cytoskeletal rearrangements and cell migration. Calpain cleaves many cytosolic proteins and therefore to be effective and limited in its scope, calpain activity has to be tightly regulated both temporally and spatially. Some mechanisms of regulation include calcium, growth factor-mediated phosphorylation and membrane targeting. Calpain inhibition reduces migration rates and inhibits cell invasiveness. Two putative mechanisms of calpain action during migration include its role as a signaling intermediate, acting upstream of Rho, and its effects on focal adhesion structure and disassembly. Therefore, calpains and downstream signaling molecules may be future targets for therapeutic interventions to treat cancer or chronic inflammation.},

We generated mutant FAK with a point mutation (V744G) that renders FAK resistant to calpain proteolysis but retains other biochemical properties of FAK.

	abstract = {Integrin-mediated adhesion is a critical regulator of cell migration. Here we demonstrate that integrin-mediated adhesion to high fibronectin concentrations induces a stop signal for cell migration by inhibiting cell polarization and protrusion. On fibronectin, the stop signal is generated through alpha 5 beta 1 integrin-mediated signaling to the Rho family of GTPases. Specifically, Cdc42 and Rac1 activation exhibits a biphasic dependence on fibronectin concentration that parallels optimum cell polarization and protrusion. In contrast, RhoA activity increases with increasing substratum concentration. We find that cross talk between Cdc42 and Rac1 is required for substratum-stimulated protrusion, whereas RhoA activity is inhibitory. We also show that Cdc42 activity is inhibited by Rac1 activation, suggesting that Rac1 activity may down-regulate Cdc42 activity and promote the formation of stabilized rather than transient protrusion. Furthermore, expression of RhoA down-regulates Cdc42 and Rac1 activity, providing a mechanism whereby RhoA may inhibit cell polarization and protrusion. These findings implicate adhesion-dependent signaling as a mechanism to stop cell migration by regulating cell polarity and protrusion via the Rho family of GTPases.},

Furthermore, mAbp1 directly interacts with the actin regulatory protein WASp-interacting protein (WIP) through its SH3 domain. Finally, we demonstrate that the interaction between mAbp1 and WIP is important in regulating dorsal ruffle formation and that WIP-mediated effects on dorsal ruffle formation require mAbp1.

Despite their structural similarity, mAbp1 and cortactin play distinct roles in podosome regulation. Cortactin was necessary for the formation of podosome dots, whereas mAbp1 was necessary for the formation of organized podosome rosettes in Src-transformed cells. We identified specific Src phosphorylation sites, Tyr337 and Tyr347 of mAbp1, which mediate the formation of podosome rosettes and degradation of the ECM. In contrast to dorsal ruffles, the interaction of mAbp1 with WASP-interacting protein (WIP) was not necessary for the formation of podosome rosettes. Finally, we showed that depletion of mAbp1 increased invasive cell migration, suggesting that mAbp1 differentially regulates matrix degradation and cell invasion.

We collected DNA and sequenced candidate genes, and we performed functional studies on neutrophils isolated from the proband and her mother. The pedigree segregated chronic osteomyelitis and cutaneous inflammation in a pattern that suggested an autosomal-dominant disorder.

Analysis of neutrophil function in the proband, including nitroblue tetrazolium tests, myeloperoxidase assays, neutrophil chemotaxis, and neutrophil chemotaxis assays, revealed no identifiable abnormalities. However, an abnormality in the luminol, but not the isoluminol, respiratory burst assays following stimulation with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) was detected in neutrophils isolated from the affected proband. Internal oxidant production was also reduced in the proband and her mother when neutrophils were treated with fMLP with or without platelet-activating factor, PMA alone, or tumor necrosis factor alpha alone. This family segregates a disorder characterized by chronic inflammation of the skin and bone. Functional differences in neutrophils exist between affected individuals and controls.

Depletion of SHIP phosphatases using morpholino oligonucleotides led to increased neutrophil 3D motility and neutrophil infiltration into wounds. The increase in neutrophil wound recruitment in SHIP morphants was rescued by treatment with low dose PI3Kγ inhibitor, suggesting that SHIP limits neutrophil motility by modulating PI3K signaling. Moreover, overexpression of the SHIP phosphatase domain in neutrophils impaired neutrophil 3D migration.

	abstract = {GRAIL (gene related to anergy in lymphocytes), is an E3 ubiquitin ligase with increased expression in anergic CD4+ T cells. The expression of GRAIL has been shown to be both necessary and sufficient for the induction of T cell (T) anergy. To date, several subsets of anergic T cells have demonstrated altered interactions with antigen-presenting cells (APC) and perturbed TCR-mediated signaling. The role of GRAIL in mediating these aspects of T cell anergy remains unclear. We used flow cytometry and confocal microscopy to examine T/APC interactions in GRAIL-expressing T cells. Increased GRAIL expression resulted in reduced T/APC conjugation efficiency as assessed by flow cytometry. Examination of single T/APC conjugates by confocal microscopy revealed altered polarization of polymerized actin and LFA-1 to the T/APC interface. When GRAIL expression was knocked down, actin polarization to the T/APC interface was restored, demonstrating that GRAIL is necessary for alteration of actin cytoskeletal rearrangement under anergizing conditions. Interestingly, proximal TCR signaling including calcium flux and phosphorylation of Vav were not disrupted by expression of GRAIL in CD4+ T cells. In contrast, interrogation of distal signaling events demonstrated significantly decreased JNK phosphorylation in GRAIL-expressing T cells. In sum, GRAIL expression in CD4+ T cells mediates alterations in the actin cytoskeleton during T/APC interactions. Moreover, in this model, our data dissociates proximal T cell signaling events from functional unresponsiveness. These data demonstrate a novel role for GRAIL in modulating T/APC interactions and provide further insight into the cell biology of anergic T cells.},

Here we identify dual roles for Rac2 during neutrophil homeostasis using a zebrafish model of primary immune deficiency induced by the human inhibitory Rac2D57N mutation in neutrophils. Noninvasive live imaging of Rac2 morphants or Rac2D57N zebrafish larvae demonstrates an essential role for Rac2 in regulating 3D motility and the polarization of F-actin dynamics and PI(3)K signaling in vivo. Tracking of photolabeled Rac2-deficient neutrophils from hematopoietic tissue also shows increased mobilization into the circulation, indicating that neutrophil mobilization does not require traditionally defined cell motility. Moreover, excessive neutrophil retention in hematopoietic tissue resulting from a constitutively active CXCR4 mutation in zebrafish warts, hypogammaglobulinemia, infections, and myelokathexis (WHIM) syndrome is partially rescued by the inhibitory Rac2 mutation. These findings reveal that Rac2 signaling is necessary for both neutrophil 3D motility and CXCR4-mediated neutrophil retention in hematopoietic tissue, thereby limiting neutrophil mobilization, a critical first step in the innate immune response.},

Although progress has been made in understanding the mechanisms that promote neutrophil recruitment to inflamed tissue, the mechanisms that regulate the resolution phase of the inflammatory response have remained relatively elusive. To define the mechanisms that regulate neutrophil-mediated inflammation in vivo, we have developed a novel transgenic zebrafish in which the neutrophils express GFP under control of the myeloperoxidase promoter (zMPO:GFP). Tissue injury induces a robust, inflammatory response, which is characterized by the rapid chemotaxis of neutrophils to the wound site. In vivo time-lapse imaging shows that neutrophils subsequently display directed retrograde chemotaxis back toward the vasculature. These findings implicate retrograde chemotaxis as a novel mechanism that regulates the resolution phase of the inflammatory response. The zMPO:GFP zebrafish provides unique insight into the mechanisms of neutrophil-mediated inflammation and thereby offers opportunities to identify new regulators of the inflammatory response in vivo.},

Medical records were reviewed to determine symptoms at presentation, referral status, and subsequent diagnoses, which were classified as serious (n=93) or benign (n=206). We found that serious underlying disease was about 7 times as likely in patients with ESR{\textgreater}50 mm/hr (57/102) than in patients with ESR{\textless}20 mm/hr (7/89). Although the prevalence of serious disease was higher among referral patients, the likelihood ratios were similar for referral and primary-care patients. An erythrocyte sedimentation rate greater than 50 mm/hr was most informative in patients presenting with limp (likelihood ratio [LR] =8.2) and abdominal pain (LR=6.0) and least informative in patients presenting with fever (LR=2.5). On the other hand, an ESR{\textless}20 mm/hr is reassuring in patients presenting with fever (LR=0) or limp (LR=0.3), but not in patients presenting with abdominal pain (LR=0.8). An ESR between 20 and 50 mm/hr (23\% of the patients) provided little information (LR 1.2-1.5) in each of the three groups. These results suggest that the ESR often provides useful information about the likelihood of serious illness among children presenting with worrisome but nonspecific symptoms, in particular in patients presenting with limp.},

Recent progress has been made in defining some of the molecular mechanisms by which adhesion disassembly is regulated, including the contributions of adhesion adaptor proteins and tyrosine kinases. However, little is known about the potential contribution of proteolytic mechanisms to the regulation of adhesion complex dynamics. Here, we show that proteolysis of talin by the intracellular calcium-dependent protease calpain is critical for focal adhesion disassembly. We have generated a single point mutation in talin that renders it resistant to proteolysis by calpain. Quantification of adhesion assembly and disassembly rates demonstrates that calpain-mediated talin proteolysis is a rate-limiting step during adhesion turnover. Furthermore, we demonstrate that disassembly of other adhesion components, including paxillin, vinculin and zyxin, is also dependent on the ability of calpain to cleave talin, suggesting a general role for talin proteolysis in regulating adhesion turnover. Together, these findings identify calpain-mediated proteolysis of talin as a mechanism by which adhesion dynamics are regulated.},

	volume = {111 ( Pt 7)},
	issn = {0021-9533},
	abstract = {Cell migration can be considered as a repeated cycle of membrane protrusion and attachment, cytoskeletal contraction and rear detachment. At intermediate and high levels of cell-substratum adhesiveness, cell speed appears to be rate-limited by rear detachment, specifically by the disruption of cytoskeleton-adhesion receptor-extracellular matrix (ECM) linkages. Often, cytoskeletal linkages fracture to release integrin adhesion receptors from the cell. Cell-extracellular matrix bonds may also dissociate, allowing the integrins to remain with the cell. To investigate molecular mechanisms involved in fracturing these linkages and regulating cell speed, we have developed an experimental system to track integrins during the process of rear retraction in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Integrin expression level was varied by transfecting CHO B2 cells, which express very little endogenous alpha5 integrin, with a plasmid containing human alpha5 integrin cDNA and sorting the cells into three populations with different alpha5 expression levels. Receptor/ligand affinity was varied using CHO cells transfected with either alphaIIbbeta3 or alphaIIbbeta3(beta1-2), a high affinity variant. alphaIIbbeta3(beta1-2) is activated to a higher affinity state with an anti-LIBS2 antibody. Fluorescent probes were conjugated to non-adhesion perturbing anti-integrin antibodies, which label integrins in CHO cells migrating on a matrix-coated glass coverslip. The rear retraction area was determined using phase contrast microscopy and integrins initially in this area were tracked by fluorescence microscopy and a cooled CCD camera. We find that rear retraction rate appears to limit cell speed at intermediate and high adhesiveness, but not at low adhesiveness. Upon rear retraction, the amount of integrin released from the cell increases as extracellular matrix concentration, receptor level and receptor-ligand affinity increase. In fact, integrin release is a constant function of cell-substratum adhesiveness and the number of cell-substratum bonds. In the adhesive regime where rear detachment limits the rate of cell migration, cell speed has an inverse relationship to the amount of integrin released at the rear of the cell. At high cell-substratum adhesiveness, calpain, a Ca2+-dependent protease, is also involved in release of cytoskeletal linkages during rear retraction. Inhibition of calpain results in decreased integrin release from the cell membrane, and consequently a decrease in cell speed, during migration. These observations suggest a model for rear retraction in which applied tension and calpain-mediated cytoskeletal linkage cleavage are required at high adhesiveness, but only applied tension is required at low adhesiveness.},

Calpain is a calcium-dependent protease that mediates cytoskeletal reorganization during cell migration. Here, we show that calpain inhibition impairs TNF-alpha-induced neutrophil firm adhesion to fibrinogen-coated surfaces and the formation of vinculin-containing focal complexes. Calpain inhibition induces random migration in TNF-alpha-stimulated cells and prevents the generation of reactive oxygen species, but does not alter TNF-alpha-mediated activation of p38 MAPK and ERK MAPK. These findings suggest that the TNF-alpha-induced neutrophil arrest requires the activity of calpain independent of p38 MAPK and ERK signaling seen after TNF-alpha stimulation.

Calpain inhibition specifically stabilizes peripheral focal adhesions, increases adhesiveness, and decreases the rate of cell detachment. Furthermore, these inhibitors alter the fate of integrin receptors at the rear of the cell during migration. A Chinese hamster ovary cell line expressing low levels of calpain I also shows reduced migration rates with similar morphological changes, further implicating calpain in this process. Taken together, the data suggest that calpain inhibition modulates cell migration by stabilizing cytoskeletal linkages and decreasing the rate of retraction of the cell's rear. Inhibiting calpain-mediated proteolysis may therefore be a potential therapeutic approach to control pathological cell migration such as tumor metastasis.},

PF-562,271 inhibits T cell receptor signaling-induced T cell adhesion to intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and T cell interactions with antigen-presenting cells. An additional focal adhesion kinase inhibitor, PF-573,228, and genetic depletion of focal adhesion kinase also impair T cell conjugation with antigen-presenting cells. PF-562,271 blocks phosphorylation of the signaling molecules zeta chain associate protein of 70 kDa, linker of activated T cells, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and impairs T cell proliferation. The effects observed on T cell proliferation cannot solely be attributed to focal adhesion kinase inhibition, as genetic depletion did not alter proliferation. The effect of PF-562,271 on T cell proliferation is not rescued when proximal T cell receptor signaling is bypassed by stimulation with phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate and ionomycin.

	abstract = {In tuberculosis, infecting mycobacteria are phagocytosed by macrophages, which then migrate into deeper tissue and recruit additional cells to form the granulomas that eventually contain infection. Mycobacteria are exquisitely adapted macrophage pathogens, and observations in the mouse model of tuberculosis have suggested that mycobacterial growth is not inhibited in macrophages until adaptive immunity is induced. Using the optically transparent and genetically tractable zebrafish embryo-Mycobacterium marinum model of tuberculosis, we have directly examined early infection in the presence and absence of macrophages. The absence of macrophages led rapidly to higher bacterial burdens, suggesting that macrophages control infection early and are not an optimal growth niche. However, we show that macrophages play a critical role in tissue dissemination of mycobacteria. We propose that residence within macrophages represents an evolutionary trade-off for pathogenic mycobacteria that slows their early growth but provides a mechanism for tissue dissemination.},

The mechanism by which the enzyme is spatially and temporally controlled is not well understood, particularly because the dependence of calpain on calcium exceeds the submicromolar concentrations normally observed in cells. Here we show that the channel kinase TRPM7 localizes to peripheral adhesion complexes with m-calpain, where it regulates cell adhesion by controlling the activity of the protease. Our research revealed that overexpression of TRPM7 in cells caused cell rounding with a concomitant loss of cell adhesion that is dependent upon the channel of the protein but not its kinase activities. Knockdown of m-calpain blocked TRPM7-induced cell rounding and cell detachment. Silencing of TRPM7 by RNA interference, however, strengthened cell adhesion and increased the number of peripheral adhesion complexes in the cells. Together, our results suggest that the ion channel TRPM7 regulates cell adhesion through m-calpain by mediating the local influx of calcium into peripheral adhesion complexes.},

However, the molecular determinants and functional consequences of its localization remain unknown. In this report, we seek to better understand the mechanisms involved in PIPKIγ90 uropod targeting and the role that PIPKIγ90 plays in T cell uropod formation. During T cell activation, PIPKIγ90 cocaps with the membrane microdomain-associated proteins flotillin-1 and -2 and accumulates in the uropod. We report that the C-terminal 26 amino acid extension of PIPKIγ90 is required for its localization to the uropod. We further use T cells from PIPKIγ90(-/-) mice and human T cells expressing a kinase-dead PIPKIγ90 mutant to examine the role of PIPKIγ90 in a T cell uropod formation. We find that PIPKIγ90 deficient T cells have elongated uropods on ICAM-1. Moreover, in human T cells overexpression of PIPKIγ87, a naturally occurring isoform lacking the last 26 amino acids, suppresses uropod formation and impairs capping of uropod proteins such as flotillins. Transfection of human T cells with a dominant-negative mutant of flotillin-2 in turn attenuates capping of PIPKIγ90. Our data contribute to the understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulate T cell uropod formation.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To create a pediatric rheumatology Top 5 list as part of the American Board of Internal Medicine Foundation's Choosing Wisely campaign.
METHODS: Delphi surveys of a core group of representative pediatric rheumatology providers from across North America generated candidate Top 5 items. Items with high content agreement and perceived to be of prevalent use and of high impact were included in a survey of all American College of Rheumatology (ACR) members who identified themselves as providing care to pediatric patients. Items with the highest ratings were subjected to literature review and further evaluation.
RESULTS: A total of 121 candidate items were proposed in the initial Delphi survey and were reduced to 28 items in subsequent surveys. These 28 items were sent to 1,198 rheumatology providers who care for pediatric patients, and 397 (33\%) responded. Based upon survey data and literature review, the Top 5 items were identified. These items focused on testing for antinuclear antibodies, autoantibody panels, Lyme disease, methotrexate toxicity monitoring, and use of routine radiographs.
CONCLUSION: The ACR pediatric rheumatology Top 5 is one of the first pediatric subspecialty-specific Choosing Wisely Top 5 lists and provides an opportunity for patients and providers to discuss appropriate use of health care in pediatric rheumatology.},

Previously, we identified gelsolin in a proteomics screen to identify proteins involved in inside-out control of integrins using the lymphocytic leukemia cell line L1210. Furthermore, we showed that gelsolin was involved in affinity regulation of β1 -integrins in the leukemic cell line U937. Here, we examined how gelsolin regulates β1 -integrin affinity in the leukemia cell line L1210. We show that gelsolin is mainly expressed at the cell membrane and is present near β1 -integrins. The role for actin polymerization in integrin affinity regulation was examined using the actin modulating agent jasplakinolide, which decreased β1 -integrin affinity. Similarly, knock-down of gelsolin in L1210 cells also decreased β1 -integrin affinity and cell adhesion to collagen. These data suggest that increased actin polymerization through gelsolin regulates β1 -integrin affinity and cell adhesion.},

	abstract = {Vitronectin, a principal cell adhesion molecule in plasma and extracellular matrix, mediates cell adhesion and spreading via the alpha V family of integrins. In this study we demonstrate that decorin, a small dermatan sulfate proteoglycan, regulates extracellular matrix remodeling in rabbit synovial fibroblasts adhering to vitronectin. Decorin induced the expression of the matrix metalloproteinase collagenase (MMP-1) when present on the substrate with vitronectin, or with the 120-kDa cell-binding domain of fibronectin, but not when present with intact fibronectin or Type I collagen. Secreted collagenase was detected within 8 h of adhesion, there was no associated alteration in cell shape or focal contact formation in cells adhering to decorin plus vitronectin, whereas cell rounding was observed in cells adhering to decorin plus the 120-kDa fragment of fibronectin. The core protein of decorin, but not the glycosaminoglycan moiety, was sufficient to induce collagenase expression on both substrates; however, the glycosaminoglycan moiety of decorin as well as the core were required for cell rounding observed in cells adhering to the 120-kDa domain of fibronectin. The collagenase-inducing effect of decorin seems to be independent of its effects on transforming growth factor-beta, as function-blocking antibodies against transforming growth factor-beta did not interfere with the collagenase-inducing effects of decorin. These data indicate that decorin has specific gene regulatory effects in cells when present in the matrix with vitronectin or the 120-kDa fragment of fibronectin, polypeptides that are present in actively remodeling tissues. Thus, in combination, these adhesion regulatory molecules transduce novel signals that may contribute to the tissue remodeling process in morphogenesis, wound healing and disease states.},

Therefore, this manuscript describes the zWEDGI (zebrafish Wounding and Entrapment Device for Growth and Imaging), which was designed and fabricated as a functionally compartmentalized device to orient larvae for high-resolution microscopy while permitting caudal fin transection within the device and subsequent unrestrained tail development and re-growth. This device allows for wounding and long-term imaging while maintaining viability. Given that the zWEDGI mold is 3D printed, the customizability of its geometries make it easily modified for diverse zebrafish imaging applications. Furthermore, the zWEDGI offers numerous benefits, such as access to the larva during experimentation for wounding or for the application of reagents, paralleled orientation of multiple larvae for streamlined imaging, and reusability of the device.},

Neutrophils displayed a rounded morphology and rapid protease-independent motility, lacked defined paxillin puncta, and had persistent rearward polarization of stable F-actin and the microtubule network. By contrast, macrophages displayed an elongated morphology with reduced speed and increased directional persistence and formed paxillin-containing puncta but had a less-defined polarization of the microtubule and actin networks.

Understanding how cells translate these cues into particular cellular behaviors is a complex yet critical area of study. We have previously shown that both neutrophils and macrophages are important for controlling the fish pathogen Streptococcus iniae. Here, we report both host and bacterial determinants leading to the formation of organized macrophage aggregates as part of the host inflammatory response in a subset of infected larvae. Streptococcal capsule was a required signal for aggregate formation. Macrophage aggregation coincided with NFκB activity, and the formation of these aggregates is mediated by leukotriene B4 (LTB4) produced by neutrophils. Depletion, inhibition, or genetic deletion of leukotriene A4 hydrolase (Lta4h), which catalyzes the last step in LTB4 synthesis, resulted in the absence of macrophage aggregation. Larvae with impaired neutrophil function also had impaired macrophage aggregation; however, aggregate formation was partially rescued with the addition of exogenous LTB4. Neutrophil-specific expression of lta4h was sufficient to rescue macrophage aggregation in Lta4h-deficient larvae and increased host survival following infection. In summary, our findings highlight a novel innate immune response to infection in which specific bacterial products drive neutrophils that modulate macrophage behavior through eicosanoid signaling.},

Two processes may be involved in action prediction; dynamic simulation (updating) and static matching. The present study examined this issue by testing the impact of action verb processing on action prediction performance using a masked priming paradigm. Evidence of dynamic updating was revealed after prime verbs expressing dynamic actions (e.g., 'to catch') but not those expressing static actions (e.g., 'to lean'). In contrast to previous work, the primes were masked and did not require any response at all. Hence, our results indicate that implicit action-related linguistic processing may trigger action simulation that in turn might affect action prediction (see also Liepelt, Dolk, \& Prinz, Psychological Research, 2012, in this issue).},

OCT allows non-invasive imaging of the tissue structure but lacks specificity to contrast agents that could be used for in vivo molecular imaging. Photothermal OCT (PT-OCT) is a functional OCT-based technique that has been developed to detect absorbers in a sample. We demonstrate in vivo PT-OCT in the eye for the first time on both endogenous (melanin) and exogenous (gold nanorods) absorbers. Pigmented mice and albino mice (n = 6 eyes) were used to isolate the photothermal signal from the melanin in the retina. Pigmented mice with laser-induced choroidal neovascularization lesions (n = 7 eyes) were also imaged after a systemic injection of gold nanorods to observe their passive accumulation in the retina. This experiment demonstrates the feasibility of PT-OCT to image the distribution of both endogenous and exogenous absorbers in the mouse retina.},

	abstract = {Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is increasingly recognized as a systemic disease driven by alteration in the normal functioning of multiple metabolic pathways affecting all of the major carbon substrates, including amino acids. We found that human pulmonary hypertension patients (WHO Group I, PAH) exhibit systemic and pulmonary-specific alterations in glutamine metabolism, with the diseased pulmonary vasculature taking up significantly more glutamine than that of controls. Using cell culture models and transgenic mice expressing PAH-causing BMPR2 mutations, we found that the pulmonary endothelium in PAH shunts significantly more glutamine carbon into the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle than wild-type endothelium. Increased glutamine metabolism through the TCA cycle is required by the endothelium in PAH to survive, to sustain normal energetics, and to manifest the hyperproliferative phenotype characteristic of disease. The strict requirement for glutamine is driven by loss of sirtuin-3 (SIRT3) activity through covalent modification by reactive products of lipid peroxidation. Using 2-hydroxybenzylamine, a scavenger of reactive lipid peroxidation products, we were able to preserve SIRT3 function, to normalize glutamine metabolism, and to prevent the development of PAH in BMPR2 mutant mice. In PAH, targeting glutamine metabolism and the mechanisms that underlie glutamine-driven metabolic reprogramming represent a viable novel avenue for the development of potentially disease-modifying therapeutics that could be rapidly translated to human studies.},

Heterogeneity in tumor cell-cycle status (e. g. proliferation, quiescence, apoptosis) increases drug resistance and tumor recurrence. Cell-cycle status is closely linked to cellular metabolism. Thus, this study applies cell-level metabolic imaging to distinguish proliferating, quiescent, and apoptotic populations. Two-photon microscopy and time-correlated single photon counting are used to measure optical redox ratio (NAD(P)H fluorescence intensity divided by FAD intensity), NAD(P)H and FAD fluorescence lifetime parameters. Redox ratio, NAD(P)H and FAD lifetime parameters alone exhibit significant differences (p{\textless}0.05) between population means. To improve separation between populations, linear combination models derived from partial least squares - discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) are used to exploit all measurements together. Leave-one-out cross validation of the model yielded high classification accuracies (92.4 and 90.1 \% for two and three populations, respectively). OMI and PLS-DA also identifies each sub-population within heterogeneous samples. These results establish single-cell analysis with OMI and PLS-DA as a label-free method to distinguish cell-cycle status within intact samples.

Drug discovery is a long, expensive, and complex process, so optimized assays can improve the success rate of drug candidates. This study applies optical imaging of cell metabolism to three-dimensional in vitro cultures of head and neck cancer grown from primary tumor tissue (organoids). This technique is advantageous because it measures cell metabolism using intrinsic fluorescence from NAD(P)H and FAD on a single cell level for a three-dimensional in vitro model. Head and neck cancer organoids are characterized alone and after treatment with standard therapies, including an antibody therapy, a chemotherapy, and combination therapy. Additionally, organoid cellular heterogeneity is analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively. Gold standard measures of treatment response, including cell proliferation, cell death, and in vivo tumor volume, validate therapeutic efficacy for each treatment group in a parallel study. Results indicate that optical metabolic imaging is sensitive to therapeutic response in organoids after 1 day of treatment (p{\textless}0.05) and resolves cell subpopulations with distinct metabolic phenotypes.

	abstract = {Time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) enables acquisition of fluorescence lifetime decays with high temporal resolution within the fluorescence decay. However, many thousands of photons per pixel are required for accurate lifetime decay curve representation, instrument response deconvolution, and lifetime estimation, particularly for two-component lifetimes. TCSPC imaging speed is inherently limited due to the single photon per laser pulse nature and low fluorescence event efficiencies ({\textless}10\%) required to reduce bias towards short lifetimes. Here, simulated fluorescence lifetime decays are analyzed by SPCImage and SLIM Curve software to determine the limiting lifetime parameters and photon requirements of fluorescence lifetime decays that can be accurately fit. Data analysis techniques to improve fitting accuracy for low photon count data were evaluated. Temporal binning of the decays from 256 time bins to 42 time bins significantly (p{\textless}0.0001) improved fit accuracy in SPCImage and enabled accurate fits with low photon counts (as low as 700 photons/decay), a 6-fold reduction in required photons and therefore improvement in imaging speed. Additionally, reducing the number of free parameters in the fitting algorithm by fixing the lifetimes to known values significantly reduced the lifetime component error from 27.3\% to 3.2\% in SPCImage (p{\textless}0.0001) and from 50.6\% to 4.2\% in SLIM Curve (p{\textless}0.0001). Analysis of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-lactate dehydrogenase (NADH-LDH) solutions confirmed temporal binning of TCSPC data and a reduced number of free parameters improves exponential decay fit accuracy in SPCImage. Altogether, temporal binning (in SPCImage) and reduced free parameters are data analysis techniques that enable accurate lifetime estimation from low photon count data and enable TCSPC imaging speeds up to 6x and 300x faster, respectively, than traditional TCSPC analysis.},

Therefore, measurements of cellular-level tumor heterogeneity could enable improved anti-cancer treatment regimens. Cancer exhibits altered cellular metabolism, which affects the autofluorescence of metabolic cofactors NAD(P)H and FAD. The optical redox ratio (fluorescence intensity of NAD(P)H divided by FAD) reflects global cellular metabolism. The fluorescence lifetime (amount of time a fluorophore is in the excited state) is sensitive to microenvironment, particularly protein-binding. High-resolution imaging of the optical redox ratio and fluorescence lifetimes of NAD(P)H and FAD (optical metabolic imaging) enables single-cell analyses. In this study, mice with FaDu tumors were treated with the antibody therapy cetuximab or the chemotherapy cisplatin and imaged in vivo two days after treatment. Results indicate that fluorescence lifetimes of NAD(P)H and FAD are sensitive to early response (two days post-treatment, P{\textless}.05), compared with decreases in tumor size (nine days post-treatment, P{\textless}.05). Frequency histogram analysis of individual optical metabolic imaging parameters identifies subpopulations of cells, and a new heterogeneity index enables quantitative comparisons of cellular heterogeneity across treatment groups for individual variables. Additionally, a dimensionality reduction technique (viSNE) enables holistic visualization of multivariate optical measures of cellular heterogeneity. These analyses indicate increased heterogeneity in the cetuximab and cisplatin treatment groups compared with the control group. Overall, the combination of optical metabolic imaging and cellular-level analyses provide novel, quantitative insights into tumor heterogeneity.},

Our approach searches for the scaling coefficients of the library by non-negative least squares approximations plus Thikonov/l(2) or l(1) regularization terms. The parameters of the library are given by the lower and upper bounds in the characteristic lifetimes of the exponential functions and the size of the library, where we observe that this last variable is not a limiting factor in the resulting fitting accuracy. We compare our proposal to nonlinear least squares and global non-linear least squares estimations with a multi-exponential model, and also to constrained Laguerre-base expansions, where we visualize an advantage of our proposal based on Thikonov/l(2) regularization in terms of estimation accuracy, computational time, and tuning strategy. Our validation strategy considers synthetic datasets subject to both shot and Gaussian noise and samples with different lifetime maps, and experimental FLIM data of ex-vivo atherosclerotic plaques and human breast cancer cells.},

Attempts to deplete the tumor stroma have resulted in formation of more aggressive tumors. We have identified signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3 as a biomarker of resistance to cytotoxic and molecularly targeted therapy in PDAC. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of targeting STAT3 on the PDAC stroma and on therapeutic resistance.
METHODS: Activated STAT3 protein expression was determined in human pancreatic tissues and tumor cell lines. In vivo effects of AZD1480, a JAK/STAT3 inhibitor, gemcitabine or the combination were determined in Ptf1a(cre/+);LSL-Kras(G12D/+);Tgfbr2(flox/flox) (PKT) mice and in orthotopic tumor xenografts. Drug delivery was analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization imaging mass spectrometry. Collagen second harmonic generation imaging quantified tumor collagen alignment and density.
RESULTS: STAT3 activation correlates with decreased survival and advanced tumor stage in patients with PDAC. STAT3 inhibition combined with gemcitabine significantly inhibits tumor growth in both an orthotopic and the PKT mouse model of PDAC. This combined therapy attenuates in vivo expression of SPARC, increases microvessel density, and enhances drug delivery to the tumor without depletion of stromal collagen or hyaluronan. Instead, the PDAC tumors demonstrate vascular normalization, remodeling of the tumor stroma, and down-regulation of cytidine deaminase.
CONCLUSIONS: Targeted inhibition of STAT3 combined with gemcitabine enhances in vivo drug delivery and therapeutic response in PDAC. These effects occur through tumor stromal remodeling and down-regulation of cytidine deaminase without depletion of tumor stromal content.},

	abstract = {Time-deconvolution of the instrument response from fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) data is usually necessary for accurate fluorescence lifetime estimation. In many applications, however, the instrument response is not available. In such cases, a blind deconvolution approach is required. An iterative methodology is proposed to address the blind deconvolution problem departing from a dataset of FLIM measurements. A linear combination of a base conformed by Laguerre functions models the fluorescence impulse response of the sample at each spatial point in our formulation. Our blind deconvolution estimation (BDE) algorithm is formulated as a quadratic approximation problem, where the decision variables are the samples of the instrument response and the scaling coefficients of the basis functions. In the approximation cost function, there is a bilinear dependence on the decision variables. Hence, due to the nonlinear nature of the estimation process, an alternating least-squares scheme iteratively solves the approximation problem. Our proposal searches for the samples of the instrument response with a global perspective, and the scaling coefficients of the basis functions locally at each spatial point. First, the iterative methodology relies on a least-squares solution for the instrument response, and quadratic programming for the scaling coefficients applied just to a subset of the measured fluorescence decays to initially estimate the instrument response to speed up the convergence. After convergence, the final stage computes the fluorescence impulse response at all spatial points. A comprehensive validation stage considers synthetic and experimental FLIM datasets of ex vivo atherosclerotic plaques and human breast cancer cell samples that highlight the advantages of the proposed BDE algorithm under different noise and initial conditions in the iterative scheme and parameters of the proposal.},

	abstract = {Photothermal OCT (PTOCT) provides high sensitivity to molecular targets in tissue, and occupies a spatial imaging regime that is attractive for small animal imaging. However, current implementations of PTOCT require extensive temporal sampling, resulting in slow frame rates and a large data burden that limit its in vivo utility. To address these limitations, we have implemented optical lock-in techniques for photothermal optical lock-in OCT (poli-OCT), and demonstrated the in vivo imaging capabilities of this approach. The poli-OCT signal was assessed in tissue-mimicking phantoms containing indocyanine green (ICG), an FDA approved small molecule that has not been previously imaged in vivo with PTOCT. Then, the effects of in vivo blood flow and motion artifact were assessed and attenuated, and in vivo poli-OCT was demonstrated with both ICG and gold nanorods as contrast agents. Experiments revealed that poli-OCT signals agreed with optical lock-in theory and the bio-heat equation, and the system exhibited shot noise limited performance. In phantoms containing biologically relevant concentrations of ICG (1 µg/ml), the poli-OCT signal was significantly greater than control phantoms (p{\textless}0.05), demonstrating sensitivity to small molecules. Finally, in vivo poli-OCT of ICG identified the lymphatic vessels in a mouse ear, and also identified low concentrations (200 pM) of gold nanorods in subcutaneous injections at frame rates ten times faster than previously reported. This work illustrates that future in vivo molecular imaging studies could benefit from the improved acquisition and analysis times enabled by poli-OCT.},

Fluorescence imaging occupies a unique niche to investigate tumor heterogeneity due to its high resolution and molecular specificity. Here, heterogeneous populations are identified and quantified by combined optical metabolic imaging and subpopulation analysis (OMI-SPA). OMI probes the fluorescence intensities and lifetimes of metabolic enzymes in cells to provide images of cellular metabolism, and SPA models cell populations as mixed Gaussian distributions to identify cell subpopulations. In this study, OMI-SPA is characterized by simulation experiments and validated with cell experiments. To generate heterogeneous populations, two breast cancer cell lines, SKBr3 and MDA-MB-231, were co-cultured at varying proportions. OMI-SPA correctly identifies two populations with minimal mean and proportion error using the optical redox ratio (fluorescence intensity of NAD(P)H divided by the intensity of FAD), mean NAD(P)H fluorescence lifetime, and OMI index. Simulation experiments characterized the relationships between sample size, data standard deviation, and subpopulation mean separation distance required for OMI-SPA to identify subpopulations.},

This study investigates the effects of trastuzumab (Tz) on the collagen of Tz-responsive (BT474) and Tz-resistant (HR6) breast cancer xenografts. Collagen content was assessed by in vivo second harmonic generation (SHG) imaging and histological trichrome staining of tumor sections. Collagen SHG imaging of control BT474 and HR6 tumors demonstrated increased collagen density after 14 days of treatment (p {\textless} 0.05). Trichrome staining revealed decreased collagen in Tz-treated BT474 and HR6 tumors at 2, 5, and 14 days of treatment, suggesting that Tz affects the tumor microenvironment independent of epithelial cell response. Additionally, collagen alignment analysis revealed significantly less aligned collagen in the Tz-treated BT474 tumors at day 14 compared with control BT474 tumors. There was no correlation between SHG endpoints (collagen density and alignment) and trichrome staining (p {\textgreater} 0.05), consistent with the physically distinctive nature of these measurements. There was also no correlation between tumor size and collagen endpoints (p {\textgreater} 0.05). These results identify changes within the collagen compartment of the tumor microenvironment following Tz treatment, which are independent from the tumor cell response to Tz, and demonstrate that intravital collagen SHG imaging is capable of measuring dynamic changes in tumor microenvironment following treatment that complements trichrome staining.},

As an early marker of drug response in cells, cellular metabolism provides an attractive platform for high-throughput drug testing. Optical techniques can noninvasively monitor NADH and FAD, two autofluorescent metabolic coenzymes. The autofluorescent redox ratio, defined as the autofluorescence intensity of NADH divided by that of FAD, quantifies relative rates of cellular glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. However, current microscopy methods for redox ratio quantification are time-intensive and low-throughput, limiting their practicality in drug screening. Alternatively, high-throughput commercial microplate readers quickly measure fluorescence intensities for hundreds of wells. This study found that a commercial microplate reader can differentiate the receptor status of breast cancer cell lines (p {\textless} 0.05) based on redox ratio measurements without extrinsic contrast agents. Furthermore, microplate reader redox ratio measurements resolve response (p {\textless} 0.05) and lack of response (p {\textgreater} 0.05) in cell lines that are responsive and nonresponsive, respectively, to the breast cancer drug trastuzumab. These studies indicate that the microplate readers can be used to measure the redox ratio in a high-throughput manner and are sensitive enough to detect differences in cellular metabolism that are consistent with microscopy results.},

PPS is hydrophobic but undergoes a phase change to become hydrophilic upon oxidation and thus provides a useful platform for ROS-demanded drug release. This platform was tested for delivery of the promising anti-inflammatory and antioxidant therapeutic molecule curcumin, which is currently limited in use in its free form due to poor pharmacokinetic properties. PPS microspheres efficiently encapsulated curcumin through oil-in-water emulsion and provided sustained, on demand release that was modulated in vitro by hydrogen peroxide concentration. The cytocompatible, curcumin-loaded microspheres preferentially targeted and scavenged intracellular ROS in activated macrophages, reduced in vitro cell death in the presence of cytotoxic levels of ROS, and decreased tissue-level ROS in vivo in the diabetic mouse hind limb ischemia model of peripheral arterial disease. Interestingly, due to the ROS scavenging behavior of PPS, the blank microparticles also showed inherent therapeutic properties that were synergistic with the effects of curcumin in these assays. Functionally, local delivery of curcumin-PPS microspheres accelerated recovery from hind limb ischemia in diabetic mice, as demonstrated using non-invasive imaging techniques. This work demonstrates the potential for PPS microspheres as a generalizable vehicle for ROS-demanded drug release and establishes the utility of this platform for improving local curcumin bioavailability for treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases.},

Moreover, recent clinical trials with treatment of angiogenic growth factors proved ineffective as increased angiogenesis triggered severe inflammation in a proportionally coupled fashion. Hence, the overarching goal of this research was to address this issue by developing a biomaterial system that enables controlled, dual delivery of pro-angiogenic C16 and anti-inflammatory Ac-SDKP peptides in a minimally-invasive way. To achieve the goal, a peptide-loaded injectable microgel system was developed and tested in a mouse model of PAD. When delivered through multiple, low volume injections, the combination of C16 and Ac-SDKP peptides promoted angiogenesis, muscle regeneration, and perfusion recovery, while minimizing detrimental inflammation. Additionally, this peptide combination regulated inflammatory TNF-α pathways independently of MMP-9 mediated pathways of angiogenesis in vitro, suggesting a potential mechanism by which angiogenic and inflammatory responses can be uncoupled in the context of PAD. This study demonstrates a translatable potential of the dual peptide-loaded injectable microgel system for PAD treatment.},

Although trastuzumab reduces production of the angiogenic factor VEGF in HER2 + tumors, the acute and sustained effects of trastuzumab on the tumor vasculature are not understood fully, particularly in trastuzumab-resistant tumors. We used mouse models of trastuzumab sensitive and trastuzumab-resistant HER2 + breast cancers to measure dynamic changes in tumor microvessel density and hemoglobin oxygenation (sO2) in vivo using quantitative hyperspectral imaging at 2, 5, 9, and 14 days after antibody treatment. Further analysis quantified the distribution of microvessels into low and high oxygenation groups, and monitored changes in these distributions with trastuzumab treatment. Gold standard immunohistochemistry was performed to validate complementary markers of tumor cell and vascular response to treatment. Trastuzumab treatment in both responsive and resistant tumors resulted in decreased sO2 5 days after initial treatment when compared to IgG-treated controls (p{\textless}0.05). Importantly, responsive tumors showed significantly higher vessel density and significantly lower sO2 than all other groups at 5 days post-treatment (p{\textless}0.05). Distribution analysis of vessel sO2 showed a significant (p{\textless}0.05) shift of highly oxygenated vessels towards lower oxygenation over the time-course in both trastuzumab-treated responsive and resistant tumors. This study suggests that longitudinal hyperspectral imaging of microvessel sO2 and density could distinguish trastuzumab-responsive from trastuzumab-resistant tumors, a finding that could be exploited in the post-neoadjuvant setting to guide post-surgical treatment decisions.},

Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is an attractive target for optical imaging because of easy access to the site using fiber optic probes. Two HNSCC cell lines, SCC25 and SCC61, were treated with Cetuximab (anti-EGFR antibody), BGT226 (PI3K/mTOR inhibitor), or cisplatin (chemotherapy) for 24 hours. Results show increased redox ratio, NADH α1 (contribution from free NADH), and FAD α1 (contribution from protein-bound FAD) for malignant cells compared with the nonmalignant cell line OKF6 (p{\textless}0.05). In SCC25 and SCC61 cells, the redox ratio is unaffected by cetuximab treatment and decreases with BGT226 and cisplatin treatment (p{\textless}0.05), and these results agree with standard measurements of proliferation rates after treatment. For SCC25, NADH α1 is reduced with BGT226 and cisplatin treatment. For SCC61, NADH α1 is reduced with cetuximab, BGT226, and cisplatin treatment. Trends in NADH α1 are statistically similar to changes in standard measurements of glycolytic rates after treatment. FAD α1 is reduced with cisplatin treatment (p{\textless}0.05). These shifts in optical endpoints reflect early metabolic changes induced by drug treatment. Overall, these results indicate that optical metabolic imaging has potential to detect early response to cancer treatment in HNSCC, enabling optimal treatment regimens and improved patient outcomes.},

	abstract = {ENOX1 is a highly conserved NADH oxidase that helps to regulate intracellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide levels in many cell types, including endothelial cells. Pharmacologic and RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated suppression of ENOX1 impairs surrogate markers of tumor angiogenesis/vasculogenesis, providing support for the concept that ENOX1 represents an antiangiogenic druggable target. However, direct genetic evidence that demonstrates a role for ENOX1 in vascular development is lacking. In this study, we exploited a zebrafish embryonic model of development to address this question. Whole-mount in situ hybridization coupled with immunofluorescence performed on zebrafish embryos demonstrate that enox1 message and translated protein are expressed in most tissues, and its expression is enriched in blood vessels and heart. Morpholino-mediated suppression of Enox1 in Tg(fli1-eGFP) and Tg(flk1-eGFP) zebrafish embryos significantly impairs the development of vasculature and blood circulation. Using in vivo multiphoton microscopy, we show that morpholino-mediated knockdown of enox1 increases NADH levels, consistent with loss of enzyme. VJ115 is a small-molecule inhibitor of Enox1's oxidase activity shown to increase intracellular NADH in endothelial cells; we used VJ115 to determine if the oxidase activity was crucial for vascular development. We found that VJ115 suppressed vasculogenesis in Tg(fli1-eGFP) embryos and impaired circulation. Previously, it was shown that suppression of ENOX1 radiosensitizes proliferating tumor vasculature, a consequence of enhanced endothelial cell apoptosis. Thus, our current findings, coupled with previous research, support the hypothesis that ENOX1 represents a potential cancer therapy target, one that combines molecular targeting with cytotoxic sensitization.},

In addition, OMI resolves differences in the basal metabolic activity of untransformed from malignant breast cells (P {\textless} 0.05) and between breast cancer subtypes (P {\textless} 0.05), defined by estrogen receptor and/or HER2 expression or absence. In vivo OMI is sensitive to metabolic changes induced by inhibition of HER2 with the antibody trastuzumab (herceptin) in HER2-overexpressing human breast cancer xenografts in mice. This response was confirmed with tumor growth curves and stains for Ki67 and cleaved caspase-3. OMI resolved trastuzumab-induced changes in cellular metabolism in vivo as early as 48 hours posttreatment (P {\textless} 0.05), whereas fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography did not resolve any changes with trastuzumab up to 12 days posttreatment (P {\textgreater} 0.05). In addition, OMI resolved cellular subpopulations of differing response in vivo that are critical for investigating drug resistance mechanisms. Importantly, OMI endpoints remained unchanged with trastuzumab treatment in trastuzumab-resistant xenografts (P {\textgreater} 0.05). OMI has significant implications for rapid cellular-level assessment of metabolic response to molecular expression and drug action, which would greatly accelerate drug development studies.},

	abstract = {The mouse hind limb ischemia (HLI) model is well established for studying collateral vessel formation and testing therapies for peripheral arterial disease, but there is a lack of quantitative techniques for intravitally analyzing blood vessel structure and function. To address this need, non-invasive, quantitative optical imaging techniques were developed to assess the time-course of recovery in the mouse HLI model. Hyperspectral imaging and optical coherence tomography (OCT) were used to non-invasively image hemoglobin oxygen saturation and microvessel morphology plus blood flow, respectively, in the anesthetized mouse after induction of HLI. Hyperspectral imaging detected significant increases in hemoglobin saturation in the ischemic paw as early as 3 days after femoral artery ligation (P {\textless} 0.01), and significant increases in distal blood flow were first detected with OCT 14 days postsurgery (P {\textless} 0.01). Intravital OCT images of the adductor muscle vasculature revealed corkscrew collateral vessels characteristic of the arteriogenic response to HLI. The hyperspectral imaging and OCT data significantly correlated with each other and with laser Doppler perfusion imaging (LDPI) and tissue oxygenation sensor data (P {\textless} 0.01). However, OCT measurements acquired depth-resolved information and revealed more sustained flow deficits following surgery that may be masked by more superficial measurements (LDPI, hyperspectral imaging). Therefore, intravital OCT may provide a robust biomarker for the late stages of ischemic limb recovery. This work validates non-invasive acquisition of both functional and morphological data with hyperspectral imaging and OCT. Together, these techniques provide cardiovascular researchers an unprecedented and comprehensive view of the temporal dynamics of HLI recovery in living mice.},

OCT can nondestructively visualize structural features in tissue at cellular-level resolution, and can exploit contrast agents to achieve molecular contrast. Photothermal OCT relies on the heat-producing capabilities of antibody-conjugated gold nanoparticles to achieve molecular contrast. A pump laser at the nanoparticle resonance wavelength is used to heat the nanoparticles in the sample, and the resulting changes in the index of refraction around the nanoparticles are detected by phase-sensitive OCT. Lock-in detection of the pump beam amplitude-modulated frequency and the detector frequency allow for high-sensitivity images of molecular targets. This approach is attractive for nondestructive three-dimensional molecular imaging deep (approximately 2 mm) within biological samples. The protocols described here achieve a sensitivity of 14 parts per million (weight/weight) nanoparticles in the sample, which is sufficient to differentiate EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor)-overexpressing cells from minimally expressing cells in three-dimensional cell constructs.},

In this report, high-speed, cross-sectional imaging of the flow fields was obtained using optical coherence tomography to track particle motion in an evaporating colloidal water drop. This approach enables z-dimensional mapping of primary and secondary flow fields and changes in these fields over time. These sectional images show that 1 μm diameter polystyrene particles have a highly nonuniform vertical distribution with particles accumulating at both the air-water interface and the water-glass interface during drop evaporation. Particle density and relative humidity are shown to influence interfacial entrapment, which suggests that both sedimentation rate and evaporation rate affect the dynamic changes in the cross-sectional distribution of particles. Furthermore, entrapment at the air-water interface delays the time at which particles reach the ring structure. These results suggest that the organization of the ring structure can be controlled based on the ratio of different density particles in a colloidal solution.},

At 37°C and pH representative of ischemic muscle (i.e. pH 5.2-7.2), these microspheres produced sustained, diffusion-controlled release, and at normal, physiological pH (i.e. pH 7.4), they underwent dissolution and rapid clearance. Delivery of fibroblast growth factor 2 was used to confirm that protein bioactivity was retained following microsphere encapsulation/release based on a dose-dependent increase in NIH3T3 fibroblast proliferation in vitro. Microsphere-loaded or free Cy5.5-labeled albumin was injected into ischemic and control gastrocnemii of mice following unilateral induction of hind limb ischemia to model peripheral arterial disease. In the ischemic limb at days 3.5 and 7, there was higher local retention of the protein delivered via microspheres relative to injected free protein (p{\textless}0.05). However, clearance of protein delivered via microspheres was equivalent to free protein at later time points that correspond to ischemic recovery in this model. Finally, histological analysis of the gastrocnemius revealed that the polymeric microspheres did not produce any microscopic signs of toxicity near the injection site. These combined results suggest that the pH- and temperature-responsive microspheres presented herein are a promising technological platform for controlled protein delivery to ischemic tissue.},

	abstract = {Optical measurements of metabolism are ideally acquired in vivo; however, intravital measurements are often impractical. Accurate ex vivo assessments would greatly broaden the applicability of optical measurements of metabolism. We investigate the use of live tissue culture experiments to serve as a surrogate for in vivo metabolic measurements. To validate this approach, NADH and FAD fluorescence intensity and lifetime images were acquired with a two-photon microscope from hamster cheek pouch epithelia in vivo, from biopsies maintained in live tissue culture up to 48 h, and from flash-frozen and thawed biopsies. We found that the optical redox ratio (fluorescence intensity of NADH/FAD) of the cultured biopsy was statistically identical to the in vivo measurement until 24 h, while the redox ratio of the frozen-thawed samples decreased by 15\% (p{\textless}0.01). The NADH mean fluorescence lifetime (τm) remained unchanged (p{\textgreater}0.05) during the first 8 h of tissue culture, while the NADH τm of frozen-thawed samples increased by 13\% (p{\textless}0.001). Cellular morphology did not significantly change between in vivo, cultured, and frozen-thawed tissues (p{\textgreater}0.05). All results were consistent across multiple depth layers in this stratified squamous epithelial tissue. Histological markers for proliferation and apoptosis also confirm the viability of tissues maintained in culture. This study suggests that short-term ex vivo tissue culture may be more appropriate than frozen-thawed tissue for optical metabolic and morphologic measurements that approximate in vivo status.},

(Z)-(+/-)-2-(1-benzylindol-3-ylmethylene)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-ol (denoted VJ115) is a novel chemical entity that inhibits the enzyme ENOX1, a NADH oxidase. Genetic and small molecule inhibition of ENOX1 inhibits endothelial cell tubule formation and tumor-mediated neo-angiogenesis. Inhibition of ENOX1 radiosensitizes tumor vasculature, a consequence of enhanced apoptosis. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these observations are not well understood. Herein, we mechanistically link ENOX1-mediated regulation of cellular NADH concentrations with proteomics profiling of endothelial cell protein expression following exposure to VJ115. Pathway Studios network analysis of potential effector molecules identified by the proteomics profiling indicated that a VJ115 exposure capable of altering intracellular NADH concentrations impacted proteins involved in cytoskeletal reorganization. The analysis was validated using RT-PCR and immunoblotting of selected proteins. RNAi knockdown of ENOX1 was shown to suppress expression of stathmin and lamin A/C, proteins identified by the proteomics analysis to be suppressed upon VJ115 exposure. These data support the hypothesis that VJ115 inhibition of ENOX1 can impact expression of proteins involved in cytoskeletal reorganization and support a hypothesis in which ENOX1 activity links elevated cellular NADH concentrations with cytoskeletal reorganization and angiogenesis.},

	abstract = {The optical redox ratio (fluorescence intensity of NADH divided by that of FAD), was acquired for a panel of breast cancer cell lines to investigate how overexpression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) affects tumor cell metabolism, and how tumor metabolism may be altered in response to clinically used HER2-targeted therapies. Confocal fluorescence microscopy was used to acquire NADH and FAD auto-fluorescent images. The optical redox ratio was highest in cells overexpressing HER2 and lowest in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells, which lack HER2, progesterone receptor, and estrogen receptor (ER). The redox ratio in ER-positive/HER2-negative cells was higher than what was seen in TNBC cells, but lower than that in HER2 overexpressing cells. Importantly, inhibition of HER2 using trastuzumab significantly reduced the redox ratio in HER2 overexpressing cells. Furthermore, the combinatorial inhibition of HER2 and ER decreased the redox ratio in ER+/HER2+ breast cancer cells to a greater extent than inhibition of either receptor alone. Interestingly, trastuzumab had little impact upon the redox ratio in a cell line selected for acquired resistance to trastuzumab. Taken together, these data indicate that the optical redox ratio measures changes in tumor metabolism that reflect the oncogenic effects of HER2 activity within the cell, as well as the response of the cell to therapeutic inhibition of HER2. Therefore, optical redox imaging holds the promise of measuring response and resistance to receptor-targeted breast cancer therapies in real time, which could potentially impact clinical decisions and improve patient outcome.},

The primary consequence of cycling hypoxia is increased tumor aggressiveness and treatment resistance beyond that of chronic hypoxia. Longitudinal imaging of tumor metabolic demand, hemoglobin oxygen saturation, and blood flow would provide valuable insight into the mechanisms and distribution of cycling hypoxia in tumors. Fluorescence imaging of metabolic demand via the optical redox ratio (fluorescence intensity of FAD/NADH), absorption microscopy of hemoglobin oxygen saturation, and Doppler optical coherence tomography of vessel morphology and blood flow are combined to noninvasively monitor changes in oxygen supply and demand in the mouse dorsal skin fold window chamber tumor model (human squamous cell carcinoma) every 6 h for 36 h. Biomarkers for metabolic demand, blood oxygenation, and blood flow are all found to significantly change with time (p{\textless}0.05). These variations in oxygen supply and demand are superimposed on a significant (p{\textless}0.05) decline in metabolic demand with distance from the nearest vessel in tumors (this gradient was not observed in normal tissues). Significant (p{\textless}0.05), but weak (r{\textless}or=0.5) correlations are found between the hemoglobin oxygen saturation, blood flow, and redox ratio. These results indicate that cycling hypoxia depends on both oxygen supply and demand, and that noninvasive optical imaging could be a valuable tool to study therapeutic strategies to mitigate cycling hypoxia, thus increasing the effectiveness of radiation and chemotherapy.},

However, high resolution molecular imaging has been limited to relatively shallow penetration depths that can be accessed with microscopy. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an optical analogue to ultrasound with relatively good penetration depth (1-2 mm) and resolution (approximately 1-10 microm). We have developed and characterized photothermal OCT as a molecular contrast mechanism that allows for high resolution molecular imaging at deeper penetration depths than microscopy. Our photothermal system consists of an amplitude-modulated heating beam that spatially overlaps with the focused spot of the sample arm of a spectral-domain OCT microscope. Validation experiments in tissuelike phantoms containing gold nanospheres that absorb at 532 nm revealed a sensitivity of 14 ppm nanospheres (weight/weight) in a tissuelike environment. The nanospheres were then conjugated to anti-EGFR, and molecular targeting was confirmed in cells that overexpress EGFR (MDA-MB-468) and cells that express low levels of EGFR (MDA-MB-435). Molecular imaging in three-dimensional tissue constructs was confirmed with a significantly lower photothermal signal (p{\textless}0.0001) from the constructs composed of cells that express low levels of EGFR compared to the overexpressing cell constructs (300\% signal increase). This technique could potentially augment confocal and multiphoton microscopy as a method for deep-tissue, depth-resolved molecular imaging with relatively high resolution and target sensitivity, without photobleaching or cytotoxicity.},

A physical model (Monte Carlo inverse model) and an empirical model (principal component analysis, (PCA)) based approach were compared for extracting diagnostic features from diffuse reflectance spectra measured in vivo from the dimethylbenz[alpha]anthracene-treated hamster cheek pouch model of oral carcinogenesis. These diagnostic features were input into a support vector machine algorithm to classify each tissue sample as normal (n=10) or neoplastic (dysplasia to carcinoma, n=10) and cross-validated using a leave one out method. There was a statistically significant decrease in the absorption and reduced scattering coefficient at 460 nm in neoplastic compared to normal tissues, and these two features provided 90\% classification accuracy. The first two principal components extracted from PCA provided a classification accuracy of 95\%. The first principal component was highly correlated with the wavelength-averaged reduced scattering coefficient. Although both methods show similar classification accuracy, the physical model provides insight into the physiological and structural features that discriminate between normal and neoplastic tissues and does not require a priori, a representative set of spectral data from which to derive the principal components.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The first objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of fluorescence spectroscopy for diagnosing pre-cancers in stratified squamous epithelial tissues in vivo using two different probe geometries with (1) overlapping versus (2) non-overlapping illumination and collection areas on the tissue surface. Probe (1) and probe (2) are preferentially sensitive to the fluorescence originating from the tissue surface and sub-surface tissue depths, respectively. The second objective was to design a novel, angled illumination fiber-optic probe to maximally exploit the depth-dependent fluorescence properties of epithelial tissues.
STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the first study, spectra were measured from epithelial pre-cancers and normal tissues in the hamster cheek pouch and analyzed with a non-parametric classification algorithm. In the second study, Monte Carlo modeling was used to simulate fluorescence measurements from an epithelial tissue model with the angled illumination probe.
RESULTS: An unbiased classification algorithm based on spectra measured with probes (1) and (2), classified pre-cancerous and normal tissues with 78 and 94\% accuracy, respectively. The angled illumination probe design provides the capability to detect fluorescence from a wide range of tissue depths in an epithelial tissue model.
CONCLUSIONS: The first study demonstrates that fluorescence originating from sub-surface tissue depths (probe (2)) is more diagnostic than fluorescence originating from the tissue surface (probe (1)) in the hamster cheek pouch model. However in general, it is difficult to know a priori the optimal probe geometry for pre-cancer detection in a particular epithelial tissue model. The angled illumination probe provides the capability to measure tissue fluorescence selectively from different depths within epithelial tissues, thus obviating the need to select a single optimal probe design for the fluorescence-based diagnosis of epithelial pre-cancers.},

AP block was sustained for 30 s with SILPs pulsed at 1 to 7 Hz. Full recovery of neuronal activity was observed 5 to 30 s post SILP exposure. These results indicate that SILP can be used for noncontact, reversible AP block. Due to the high spatial precision and noncontact manner of infrared light delivery, AP block by SILP (infrared neural inhibition) has the potential to transform medical care for sustained pain inhibition and suppression of unwanted nerve activity.},

The purpose of this study is to explore the effect of temperature on the fluorescence of porcine cornea and rat skin and determine the relative contributions of irreversible changes in optical properties and in fluorescence yield.
STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fluorescence, diffuse reflectance, and temperature measurements were acquired from excised porcine cornea and rat skin over a temperature range of 0-80 °C. A dual excitation system was used with a 337 nm pulsed nitrogen laser for the fluorescence and a white light source for the diffuse reflectance measurements. A thermal camera measured tissue temperature. Optical property changes were inferred from diffuse reflectance measurements. The reversibility of the change in fluorescence was examined by acquiring measurements while the tissue sample cooled from the highest induced temperature to room temperature.
RESULTS: The fluorescence intensity decreased with increasing tissue temperature. This fluorescence change was reversible when the tissue was heated to a temperature of 45 °C, but irreversible when heated to a temperature of 80 °C.
CONCLUSION: Auto-fluorescence intensity dependence on temperature appears to be a combination of temperature-induced optical property changes and reduced fluorescence quantum yield due to changes in collagen structure. Temperature-induced changes in measured fluorescence must be taken into consideration in applications where fluorescence is used to diagnose disease or guide therapy.},

The contralateral breast was used as a reference to derive the difference from breast tumor as a difference in total hemoglobin Δ[HBtot] and a difference in deoxygenation Δ([Hb]-[HbO2]). A total of 91 invasive cancers, 26 DCIS, 45 fibroblastomas, 96 benign tumors excluding cysts, and 67 normal breasts were examined from four hospitals. In larger-size tumors, there is significantly higher deoxygenation in invasive and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) than in that of benign tumors, but no significant difference was seen in smaller tumors of ≤ 1 cm. With the two parameters of high total hemoglobin and hypoxia score, the sensitivity and specificity of cancer detection were 60.3 \% and 85.3 \%, respectively. In summary, smaller-size tumors are difficult to detect with NIRS, whereas DCIS can be detected by the same total hemoglobin and hypoxic score in our study.},

Development of NIRS technologies has focused on improving quantification of the signal using multiple wavelengths to solve for absorption and scattering coefficients, multiple pathlengths to correct for the influence of superficial skin and fat, and time-resolved and phase-modulated light sources to determine optical pathlengths. In addition, advances in optical imaging with multiple source and detector pairs as well as portability using small wireless detectors have expanded the usefulness of the devices. NIRS measurements have provided information on oxidative metabolism in various athletes during localized exercise and whole-body exercise, as well as training-induced adaptations. Furthermore, NIRS technology has been used in the study of a number of chronic health conditions. Future developments of NIRS technology will include enhancing signal quantification. In addition, advances in NIRS imaging and portability promise to transform how measurements of oxygen utilization are obtained in the future.},

Evaluation of r-Bchl-BOA-LDL as a potential photosensitizer was performed using a tumor response and foot response assay.
RESULTS \& DISCUSSION: When compared with controls, tumor regrowth was significantly delayed at injected murine doses of 2 µmole/kg r-Bchl-BOA-LDL after illumination at fluences of 125, 150 or 175 J/cm(2). Foot response assays showed that although normal tissue toxicity accompanied the higher fluences it was significantly reduced at the lowest fluence tested.
CONCLUSION: This research demonstrates that r-Bchl-BOA-LDL is an effective photosensitizer and a promising candidate for further investigation.},

	abstract = {Pancreas-specific deletion of PTEN in mice revealed progressive premalignant lesions such as ductal metaplasia with infrequent malignant transformation. In this study, we aimed at evaluating the mitochondrial redox state of the metaplastic pancreas in a pancreas-specific PTEN null transgenic mouse model. The two intrinsic fluorophores, reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and oxidized flavoproteins (Fp) such as flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), in the respiratory chain in mitochondria are sensitive indicators of mitochondrial redox states and have been applied to the studies of mitochondrial function with energy-linked processes. The redox ratio, Fp/(Fp+NADH) provides a sensitive index of mitochondrial redox state. We have obtained optical images of the in vivo mitochondrial redox states of the snap frozen pancreases from pancreas-specific PTEN null mice (Pdx1-Cre;PTEN(lox/lox), N=3) and the controls (PTEN(lox/lox), N=3) using the redox scanner at low temperature. The results showed high spatial heterogeneity of mitochondrial redox state in the mutated pancreases with hot spots of much higher Fp redox ratios whereas the normal ones, were relatively homogenous. The cystic dilation regions in the metaplastic pancreases showed little to no NADH or Fp signal. Histological analysis confirmed no cells existed in these regions. It is the first time that the in vivo mitochondrial redox states of the metaplastic mouse pancreas were optically imaged. Our previous results on human melanoma and breast cancer mouse xenografts have shown that mitochondrial redox state quantitatively correlates with cancer metastatic potential. The more oxidative mitochondrial redox state (higher Fp redox ratio) corresponded to the higher metastatic potential of the tumors. As mitochondrial redox state imbalance is associated with abnormal mitochondrial function, and redox state mediates the generation of reactive oxygen species and many signal transduction pathways, this research may provide insights for studying basic biology and developing early diagnostic imaging biomarkers for pancreatic cancer.},

The nominal concentrations of NADH and Fp in tissue were measured using reference standards and used to calculate the Fp redox ratio, Fp(NADH+Fp). We observed significant core-rim differences, with the core being more oxidized than the rim in all aggressive tumors but not in the indolent tumors. These results are consistent with our previous observations on human melanoma mouse xenografts, indicating that mitochondrial redox imaging potentially provides sensitive markers for distinguishing aggressive from indolent breast tumor xenografts.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cyclosporine A (CsA) limits myocardial reperfusion injury and preserves mitochondrial integrity, but its influence on mitochondrial function has not been described in vivo. Auto-fluorescence of mitochondrial nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and flavin adenine dinucleotide correlate with mitochondrial dysfunction. We hypothesized that CsA limits mitochondrial dysfunction and that fluorometry can quantify this influence.
METHODS: Seventeen rabbits were studied: untreated (UnT, n = 7), CsA preinfarction (CsAp, n = 6), and CsA on reperfusion (CsAr, n = 4). Animals underwent 30 minutes of myocardial ischemia and 3 hours reperfusion. Infarct size was determined by staining. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and flavin adenine dinucleotide fluorescence was continually measured in the risk area. The redox ratio was calculated [flavin adenine dinucleotide(f)/(flavin adenine dinucleotide(f) + nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide(f))]. Electron microscopy evaluated mitochondria morphology.
RESULTS: The infarct size by group was 39.1\% +/- 1.7\% in CsAp, 39.1\% +/- 1.7\% in CsAr, and 53.4\% +/- 1.9\% in UnT (p {\textless} 0.001). During ischemia, the CsAp group demonstrated less hypoxic reduction, with the redox ratio decreasing to 75.6\% +/- 4.1\% of baseline. The UnT and CsAr groups deceased to 67.1\% +/- 4.0\% and 67.2\% +/- 3.6\%, respectively (p {\textless} 0.005). During reperfusion the UnT group redox ratio increased to 1.59 +/- 0.04 times baseline. This increase was blunted in the CsAp (1.17 +/- 0.04, p = 0.026) and CsAr (1.35 +/- 0.02, p = 0.056) groups. Electron microscopy revealed reduced mitochondrial disruption in CsAp (19.7\% +/- 7.6\%) and CsAr (18.1\% +/- 7.1\%) rabbits compared with UnT (53.3\% +/- 12.5\%).
CONCLUSIONS: Fluorometric spectroscopy can be used in vivo to quantitatively assess the time course of CsA's influence on the mitochondrial dysfunction associated with myocardial ischemia and reperfusion.},

Based on the BB and VL muscle oxygenation patterns, two points are used to characterize the muscle oxygenation kinetics in both the arm and the leg muscles. The first point is the breaking point (Bp), which refers to an accelerated fall in muscle oxygenation that correlates with the gas exchange threshold (GET). The second point is the leveling-off point (Lo), which suggests the upper limit of O(2) extraction. The GET occurred at 63.3+/-2.4\% of maximal oxygen uptake (VO(2 max)). The Bp appeared at 45.0+/-3.8\% and 55.6+/-2.4\% VO(2 max) in the BB and VL, respectively. The Lo appeared at 63.6+/-4.1\% and 86.6+/-1.0\% VO(2 max) in these two muscles, respectively. Both the Bp and the Lo occurred earlier in BB compared with VL. These results suggest that arm muscles have lower oxidative capacity than leg muscles during rowing exercise. The rowers with higher exercise performances showed heavier workloads, as evaluated by Bp and Lo.

The PFC of six human subjects in response to anagram tasks is investigated using multichannel fNIRS. Concentration changes of oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin in the PFC are measured with variable anagram durations and at two difficulty levels (four- and six-letter anagrams). The durations to perform the selected anagram tasks range from several seconds to more than one minute. The dorsolateral PFC areas exhibit consistent and strong hemodynamic deactivation during and shortly after task execution. The superposition principle of a linear system is employed to investigate nonlinear hemodynamic features among three task duration subgroups: D1 = 2.0 sec, D2 = 4.0 sec, and D3 = 8.0 sec. Such analysis shows clear nonlinearity in hemodynamic responses on the PFC with task durations shorter than 4 sec. Our observation of significant deactivation in early hemodynamic responses in the PFC is consistent with multiple fNIRS studies and several reports given in the field of functional magnetic resonance imaging. A better understanding of nonlinearity in fNIRS signals will have potential for us to investigate brain adaptation and to extrapolate neuronal activities from hemodynamic signals.},

The redox scanning method developed at the Chance laboratory about 30 years ago has allowed 3D high-resolution ({\textasciitilde} 50 × 50 × 10 μm(3)) imaging of mitochondrial redox state in tissue on the basis of the fluorescence of NADH (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) and Fp (oxidized flavoproteins including flavin adenine dinucleotide, i.e., FAD). In this review, we illustrate its basic principles, recent technical developments, and biomedical applications to cancer diagnostic and therapeutic studies in small animal models. Recently developed calibration procedures for the redox imaging using reference standards allow quantification of nominal NADH and Fp concentrations, and the concentration-based redox ratios, e.g., Fp/(Fp+NADH) and NADH/(Fp+NADH) in tissues. This calibration facilitates the comparison of redox imaging results acquired for different metabolic states at different times and/or with different instrumental settings. A redox imager using a CCD detector has been developed to acquire 3D images faster and with a higher in-plane resolution down to 10 μm. Ex vivo imaging and in vivo imaging of tissue mitochondrial redox status have been demonstrated with the CCD imager. Applications of tissue redox imaging in small animal cancer models include metabolic imaging of glioma and myc-induced mouse mammary tumors, predicting the metastatic potentials of human melanoma and breast cancer mouse xenografts, differentiating precancerous and normal tissues, and monitoring the tumor treatment response to photodynamic therapy. Possible future directions for the development of redox imaging are also discussed.},

Furthermore, malignant lesions exhibited a twofold average increase in optical index. The influence of core biopsy on DOT results was also explored; the difference between the malignant group measured before core biopsy and the group measured more than 1 week after core biopsy was not significant. Benign tumors (N=10) did not exhibit statistical significance in the tumor-to-normal ratios of any parameter. Optical index and tumor-to-normal ratios of total hemoglobin, oxy-hemoglobin concentration, and scattering exhibited high area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values from 0.90 to 0.99, suggesting good discriminatory power. The data demonstrate that benign and malignant lesions can be distinguished by quantitative three-dimensional DOT.},

Studies were performed on a panel of human melanoma xenografts that spanned the full range of metastatic potential measured by an in vivo lung colony assay and an in vitro membrane invasion culture system. Three imaging methods potentially transferable to the clinic [dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI, T(1(rho))-MRI, and low-temperature fluorescence imaging (measurable on biopsy specimens)] distinguished between relatively less metastatic and more metastatic human melanoma xenografts in nude mice. DCE-MRI, analyzed with the shutter-speed relaxometric algorithm and using an arterial input function simultaneously measured in the left ventricle of the mouse heart, yielded a blood transfer rate constant, K(trans), that measures vascular perfusion/permeability. K(trans) was significantly higher in the core of the least metastatic melanoma (A375P) than in the core of the most metastatic melanoma (C8161). C8161 melanoma had more blood vascular structures but fewer functional blood vessels than A375P melanoma. The A375P melanoma exhibited mean T(1(rho)) values that were significantly higher than those of C8161 melanoma. Measurements of T(1) and T(2) relaxation times did not differ significantly between these 2 melanomas. The mitochondrial redox ratio, Fp/(Fp + NADH), where Fp and NADH are the fluorescences of oxidized flavoproteins and reduced pyridine nucleotides, respectively, varied linearly with the in vitro invasive potential of the 5 melanoma cell lines (A375P, A375M, A375P10, A375P5, and C8161). This study shows that a harsh microenvironment may promote melanoma metastasis and provides potential biomarkers of metastatic potential.},

Effectiveness, however, varies significantly between patients and has implications for long-term prognosis and treatment. A technique to assess the extent of myocardial salvage after reperfusion therapy would allow for high-risk patients to be identified in the early post-MI period. Mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with cell death following myocardial reperfusion and can be quantified by fluorometry. Therefore, we hypothesized that variations in the fluorescence of mitochondrial nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and flavoprotein (FP) can be used acutely to predict the degree of myocardial injury. Thirteen rabbits had coronary occlusion for 30 min followed by 3 h of reperfusion. To produce a spectrum of infarct sizes, six animals were infused cyclosporine A prior to ischemia. Using a specially designed fluorometric probe, NADH and FP fluorescence were measured in the ischemic area. Changes in NADH and FP fluorescence, as early as 15 min after reperfusion, correlated with postmortem assessment infarct size ( r = 0.695, p {\textless} 0.01). This correlation strengthened with time ( r = 0.827, p {\textless} 0.001 after 180 min). Clinical application of catheter-based myocardial fluorometry may provide a minimally invasive technique for assessing the early response to reperfusion therapy.},

	volume = {15},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to examine the changes in total hemoglobin (Delta[tHb]) response during bicycle exercise at various constant workloads using near infrared continuous wave spectroscopy (NIRcws) in humans. We hypothesized that the Delta[tHb] during exercise may progressively increase as a result of a dilation of the vascular bed and/or capillary recruitment at lower constant work rates.
MATERIAL/METHODS: Seven healthy subjects performed bicycle exercise at 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100\% of maximal work rates (Wmax) for 5 min. Muscle oxygenation change (Delta[Oxy]) and Delta[tHb] at the right vastus lateralis were monitored using a NIRcws device. Exercise-induced Delta[tHb] and Delta[Oxy] responses at each constant workload were evaluated as functional Delta[tHb] change (f-Delta[tHb]) and functional oxygenation change (f-Delta[Oxy]), respectively. Blood lactate concentration [La] was also evaluated after each exercise stage.
RESULTS: At work rates 60\%Wmax and below, after an initial decrease at the start of exercise, both Delta[tHb] and Delta[Oxy] showed progressive increases until the end of exercise. A significant positive correlation was found between f-Delta[tHb] and f-Delta[Oxy] (p{\textless}0.01). In addition, there was a significant negative relationship of [La] to f-Delta[tHb] during exercise (p{\textless}0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: These results provide evidence that increased muscle oxygenation during bicycle exercise up to 60\%Wmax may be caused by increased O2 supply due to exercise-induced blood volume expansion. Subsequently, the cessation of increase in f-Delta[tHb] at higher intensity exercise may lead to lower muscle tissue oxygenation and higher lactate accumulation.},

We have previously reported investigations utilizing various MR/optical imaging methods to differentiate human melanoma mouse xenografts spanning a range of metastatic potentials.

We obtained the cryogenic tumor sections of three types of human melanoma mouse xenografts with their metastatic potentials falling in the rank order A375P{\textless}A375M{\textless}C8161. Both H\&E and DAPI counter-stained TUNEL analysis showed distinct core-rim difference in aggressive tumors, while the core has apparently many viable cells forming structure of vascular-like networks and the rim appears viable-cell dense. The least aggressive ones (A375P) are relatively more homogenous without distinct core-rim difference. However, our previous study showed the core of more aggressive melanoma has higher Fp/NADH redox ratio, indicative of nutritional deprivation. Additionally, the low perfusion/blood vessel permeability measured previously by DCE-MRI indicated these cells should be under starvation presumably accompanied with more cell death. Thus, it remains an open question what the survival status of the cells in the core of more aggressive melanoma is. We are currently investigating whether these cells are in autophagic state, a possible cell survival mechanism under starvation conditions.},

Extension to other lipoproteins ranging in diameter from about 10 nm (high-density lipoprotein [HDL]) to over a micron (chylomicrons) is feasible. Loading of contrast or therapeutic agents onto or into these particles has been achieved by protein loading (covalent attachment to protein side chains), surface loading (intercalation into the phospholipid monolayer), and core loading (extraction and reconstitution of the triglyceride/cholesterol ester core). Core and surface loading of LDL have been used for delivery of optical imaging agents to tumor cells in vivo and in culture. Surface loading was used for delivery of gadolinium-bis-stearylamide contrast agents for in vivo MRI detection in tumor-bearing mice. Chlorin and phthalocyanine near-infrared photodynamic therapy agents ({\textless} or = 400/LDL) have been attached by core loading. Protein loading was used to reroute the LDL from its natural receptor (LDLR) to folate receptors and could be used to target other receptors. A semisynthetic nanoparticle has been constructed by coating magnetite iron oxide nanoparticles with carboxylated cholesterol and overlaying a monolayer of phospholipid to which apolipoprotein A1 or E was adsorbed for targeting HDL or adsorbing synthetic amphipathic helical peptides ltargeting LDL or folate receptors.

We next employ a two-compartment model composed of plasma, and extracellular-extravascular space (EES), and estimate the pharmacokinetic rates and concentrations in each compartment using the extended Kalman filtering framework. The pharmacokinetic-rate images of the three patient show that the rates from the tumor region and outside the tumor region are statistically different. Additionally, the ICG concentrations in plasma, and the EES compartments are higher around the tumor region agreeing with the hypothesis that around the tumor region ICG may act as a diffusible extravascular flow in compromised capillary of cancer vessels.

Here we show that the MPT regulates the release of cytochrome c for apoptosis during endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress by remodeling the cristae junction (CJ). CEM cells, HCT116 colon cancer cells, and murine embryo fibroblast cells were treated with the ER stressor thapsigargin (THG), which led to cyclophilin D-dependent mitochondrial release of the profusion GTPase optic atrophy 1 (OPA1), which controls CJ integrity, and cytochrome c, leading to apoptosis. Interference RNA knockdown of Bax blocked OPA1 and cytochrome c release after THG treatment but did not prevent the MPT, showing that Bax was essential for the release of cytochrome c by MPT. In isolated mitochondria, MPT led to OPA1 and cytochrome c release independently of voltage-dependent anion channel and the outer membrane, indicating that the MPT is an inner membrane phenomenon. Last, the MPT was regulated by the electron transport chain but not mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, since THG-induced cell death was not blocked by antioxidants and did not occur in cells lacking mitochondrial DNA. Our results show that the MPT regulates CJ remodeling for cytochrome c-dependent apoptosis induced by ER stress and that mitochondrial electron transport is indispensable for this process.},

Indolent tumors exhibited T(1rho), values that were significantly higher than those of aggressive tumors at spin-locking frequencies {\textgreater}500 Hz. The mitochondrial redox ratio, Fp/(Fp+NADH), where Fp and NADH are the fluorescence of oxidized flavoproteins and reduced pyridine nucleotides, respectively, of aggressive tumors was much higher (more oxidized) than that of indolent tumors and often showed a bimodal distribution with an oxidized core and a reduced rim.

Eleven experienced resistance trained male athletes (age: 20.8 +/- 1.3 years; weight: 96.2 +/- 14.4 kg; height: 182.4 +/- 7.3 cm) performed 4 sets of the squat exercise using either a low-intensity, high-volume (LI; 15 repetitions at 60\% 1 repetition maximum [1RM]) or high-intensity, low-volume (HI; 4 repetitions at 90\% 1RM load). Venous blood samples were obtained before the exercise (PRE), immediately following the exercise (IP), and 20 (20P) and 40 minutes (40P) postexercise. Continuous wave near-infrared spectroscopy was used to measure muscle deoxygenation in the vastus lateralis during exercise. Deoxygenated Hb/Mb change was used to determine reoxygenation rate during recovery. No difference in MDA concentrations was seen between LI and HI at any time. Significant correlations were observed between plasma MDA concentrations at IP and the half-time recovery (T1/2 recovery) of muscle reoxygenation (r = 0.45) and between T1/2 recovery and the area under the curve for MDA concentrations (r = 0.44). Results suggest that increases in MDA occur independently of exercise intensity, but tissue acidosis may have a larger influence on MDA formation.},

Myocyte apoptosis has been shown clinically to contribute to infarct size following reperfusion of ischemic myocardium. A noninvasive means of assessing apoptosis in this setting would aid in the treatment of subsequent ventricular remodeling. We show that in vivo fluorometry can be useful in apoptosis detection in open-chest surgeries. Specific changes in myocardial redox states have been shown to indicate the presence of apoptosis. Two main mitochondrial intrinsic fluorophores, NADH and FP signals, were measured during normoxia, ischemia, and reperfusion experimental protocol. Ischemia was induced by occlusion of the largest branch of the circumflex coronary artery and fluorescence signals are collected by applying two different fluorescence techniques: in vivo fluorometry and postmortem cryoimaging. The first technique was employed to detect FP and NADH signals in vivo and the latter technique uses freeze trapping and low-temperature fluorescence imaging. The heart is snap frozen while still in the chest cavity to make a "snapshot" of the metabolic state of the tissue. After freezing, the ischemic area and its surrounding border zone were excised and the sample was embedded in a frozen buffer for cryoscanning. These two data sets, in vivo fluorometry and low-temperature redox scanning, show consistent extreme oxidation of the mitochondrial redox states (higher redox ratio) suggesting the initiation of apoptosis following reperfusion. This represents the first attempt to assess myocyte apoptosis in the beating heart.},

However, the pathophysiology involved in PAD is unclear. This study was conducted to evaluate the hemodynamic response to exercise of patients with and without diabetes and PAD.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The hemodynamic response in calf muscles of patients with diabetes, PAD, or both was determined using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Patients performed both a plantar-flexion and treadmill-walking exercise regimen.
RESULTS: Skeletal muscle capillary blood volume expansion during exercise, as measured by NIRS, was significantly impaired in the lower extremities of diabetic patients with a normal ankle-brachial index. The relative deoxygenation and oxygenation recovery times measured by NIRS correlates significantly with the presence of PAD.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with diabetes have reduced capillary volume expansion even without PAD. This is likely due to impaired vasodilation secondary to endothelial dysfunction. Further studies are needed to determine whether pharmaceutical intervention improves the blood volume expansion in the diabetic state.},

	doi = {10.1186/1476-5918-5-5},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: This article introduces a novel method to continuously monitor regional muscle blood flow by using Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS). We demonstrate the feasibility of the new method in two ways: (1) by applying this new method of determining blood flow to experimental NIRS data during exercise and ischemia; and, (2) by simulating muscle oxygenation and blood flow values using these newly developed equations during recovery from exercise and ischemia.
METHODS: Deoxy (Hb) and oxyhemoglobin (HbO2), located in the blood of the skeletal muscle, carry two internal relationships between blood flow and oxygen consumption. One is a mass transfer principle and the other describes a relationship between oxygen consumption and Hb kinetics in a two-compartment model. To monitor blood flow continuously, we transfer these two relationships into two equations and calculate the blood flow with the differential information of HbO2 and Hb. In addition, these equations are used to simulate the relationship between blood flow and reoxygenation kinetics after cuff ischemia and a light exercise. Nine healthy subjects volunteered for the cuff ischemia, light arm exercise and arm exercise with cuff ischemia for the experimental study.
RESULTS: Analysis of experimental data of both cuff ischemia and light exercise using the new equations show greater blood flow (four to six times more than resting values) during recovery, agreeing with previous findings. Further, the simulation and experimental studies of cuff ischemia and light exercise agree with each other.
CONCLUSION: We demonstrate the accuracy of this new method by showing that the blood flow obtained from the method agrees with previous data as well as with simulated data. We conclude that this novel continuous blood flow monitoring method can provide blood flow information non-invasively with NIRS.},

	abstract = {It is proposed that the redox state of mitochondrial NADH will complement blood gas analysis for measuring the health and welfare of human tissues. Use of arterial oxygen saturation levels (SaO2), especially as assayed by the Nellcor instrument, has spread almost everywhere in medicine despite the fact that hypoxia of internal organs, liver, kidney, brain, pancreas, etc. is not well indicated by peripheral digital oxygenation. Indeed, there is an implied liability in the failure to infer central oxygenation from peripheral values. Near infrared (NIR) sensing of deep tissue saturation of hemoglobin (StO2) requires multi-wavelength, multi-site measurement of both absorption and scattering properties by time or frequency domain NIR methods. Corrections for underlying water and lipid absorptions can be made so that the correct value for, and saturation oh hemoglobin are obtained. Nevertheless, the significance of blood oxygen saturation, even localized to particular organs, can be questioned from the standpoint of what is the critical value of the desaturation from which the tissue can recover; for example, in the case of cortical neurons where stroke, compression ischemia, etc. cause O2 lack, this value becomes of significant clinical importance in both the brain and the spinal chord. These approaches are actively pursued and the possibility of subsurface redox state measurement in human tissues may eventually emerge as the quantitative metric of tissue metabolic state and of hypoxic stress. The great flexibility and versatility of the fast, economical and "tetherless" nature of opto-electronic technology is appropriate to the manifold challenges of neuronal function as currently measured by intrinsic signals and soon to be studiable by extrinsic signals of metabolism and electrophysiological functions.},

We sought to answer the question: how does the compression during breast examination impact on the circulatory systems of the breast tissue, namely blood flow, blood pooling, and oxygen concentration? We assumed that the blood was distributed in two compartments, arterial and venous. All the parameters were expressed with oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin quantities and were measured with a non-invasive method, Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS). The simulated data showed that the blood volume pool in the breast decreased due to lower arterial flow and higher venous outflow, as the breast was squeezed under 100 cm H2O with a 10 cm diameter probe (or 78 cm2). The blood volume was reversed when the pressure was released. The breast venous oxygen saturation dropped, but overall tissue saturation (presenting NIRS signal, volume weighted average saturation) was increased. The results showed that simulation can be used to obtain venous and average oxygen saturation as well as blood flow in compressed breast tissues.},

Here we explored the accuracy with which this instrument can be expected to perform over a range of fetal hypoxic states. We investigated the dependence of this accuracy on the accuracy of the reference optical properties chosen based on the literature. The fetal oxygenation of a pregnant ewe model was altered via maternal aortic occlusion. The NIR cw instrument was placed on the maternal abdomen directly above the fetal head, continuously acquiring diffuse optical measurements. Blood was sampled periodically from the fetus to obtain fetal arterial saturation (SaO2) measurements from blood gas analysis. The NIR StO2 values were compared with the fetal SaO2 measurements. Variations in the NIR results due to uncertainty in the reference optical properties were relatively small within the fetal SaO2 range of 30 to 80\%. Under hypoxic conditions, however, the variability of the NIR StO2 calculations with changes in the assumed reference properties became more significant.},

	abstract = {My perspective does not deal directly with photosynthesis research. However, the methods evolved have played an important role in several areas of biochemistry and biophysics including photosynthesis. Improvements of rapid reaction methods, based upon the pioneering studies of Hamilton Hartridge and F.J.W. Roughton, and Glenn Millikan, required a detailed study of the hydraulics of small-bore tubes and jet mixers, taking into account, that economy of reactants was demanded by the sparcity of enzyme preparations in the 1930s. This Personal perspective recites the steps taken to minimize the volumes expended in rapid flow studies, together with the improvements in electronic technology of rapid and sensitive spectrophotometry of labile intermediates in enzyme reactions. Of the methods studied, continuous, accelerated and stopped flow, the latter was designed for the highest fluid economy and subsequently proved to be of wide use for studying biochemical kinetics. Advances in fast spectrophotometry of dilute solutions led to great improvements in Millikan's dual-wavelength system, both in speed of recording and decreases of background noise level, largely due to electronic stabilization of light sources and sensitive amplifiers. The application of these technologies to studies of hemoglobin, myoglobin and heme enzymes was, more recently, followed by studies of suspensions of organelles, cells, and tissues not only in vivo but also at low temperatures with cryoprotectants, leading to the use of flash activation in carbon monoxide inhibited heme enzymes. Laser technology allowed photosynthetic systems to be studied at cryotemperatures, leading to the development of electron tunneling theories for biological reactions (not discussed in this paper). All in all, the many fundamental developments of electronics, optics and hydraulics indicate how technology can respond effectively to the needs of biology in general, and photobiology in particular.},

In our preliminary study, a clinically relevant photosensitizer (HPPH, a chlorophyll-a analog) was linked with a cyanine dye (with required photophysical characteristics but limited tumor selectivity), and the resulting conjugate was found to be an efficient tumor imaging (fluorescence imaging) and photosensitizing agent. Compared to HPPH, the presence of the cyanine dye moiety in the conjugate produced a significantly higher uptake in tumor than skin. At a therapeutic/imaging dose, the conjugate did not show any significant skin phototoxicity, a major drawback associated with most of the porphyrin-based photosensitizers. These results suggest that tumor-avid porphyrin-based compounds can be used as "vehicles" to deliver the desired fluorescent agent(s) to tumor. The development of tumor imaging or improved photodynamic therapy agent(s) by itself represents an important step, but a dual function agent (fluorescence imaging and photodynamic therapy) provides the potential for tumor detection and targeted photodynamic therapy, combining two modalities into a single cost-effective "see and treat" approach.},

	abstract = {RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To demonstrate that near-infrared spectroscopy would achieve sufficient sensitivity and specificity in human breast cancer to reach ROC/AUC values in the 90s and yet to warn of the potential liabilities of introduction of a novel technology in this field.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 116 subjects from two nations (44 were cancer-verified by biopsy and histopathology) were reviewed. NIR spectroscopy of total hemoglobin and its relative oxygenation were monitored in breast cancers and compared to their contralateral breast in a 2D nomogram for diagnostic evaluation. A novel handheld NIR breast cancer detector pad with a 3-wavelength LED and 8 detectors with 4 cm separation between source and detectors was placed on the subject's breast. The method is convenient, rapid, and safe and has achieved high patient compliance with minimal patient apprehension of compression, confinement, or radioactivity.
RESULTS: The absorbance increments of the cancerous region are referred to the mirror image location on the contralateral breast. The two metrics are increased hemoglobin concentration due to angiogenesis and decreased hemoglobin saturation due to hypermetabolism of the cancer. The 2D nomogram display of these two metrics shows Zone 1 contains verified cancers and Zone 2 contains noncancers. ROC evaluation of the nomogram gives 95\% AUC for the two sites, Philadelphia and Leipzig.
CONCLUSION: A simple, economical breast cancer detector has achieved high patient compliance and a high ROC/AUC score for a population which involved a range of tumors down to and including those of 0.8-1 cm in diameter.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the validity of transabdominal pulse oximetry using a sheep fetal hypoxia model with fetal arterial hemoglobin saturation.
METHODS: Four pregnant ewes were anaesthetized and cannulated through the brachial artery to measure direct arterial blood saturation, SaO(2). Next, the transabdominal pulse oximeter was used to measure indirect measurement of the arterial saturation of the fetus, SpO(2), from the maternal abdomen. Hypoxia was induced by a balloon placed in the maternal aorta.
RESULTS: There is a linear relationship between SaO(2), arterial blood saturation values of the fetus, and SpO(2), the values measured by the transabdominal pulse oximetry with a slope of 0.75 (r(2)=0.76).
CONCLUSION: This information can be used to calibrate the transabdominal pulse oximeter as a measurement of fetal arterial saturation. With these results, we can advance the accurate, no-risk, noninvasive transabdominal fetal pulse oximeter for human use. This research may contribute to the more accurate diagnosis of the diseases of the fetus including Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy.},

In this paper, we propose a hierarchical Bayesian approach to improve spatial resolution and quantitative accuracy by using a priori information provided by a secondary high resolution anatomical imaging modality, such as magnetic resonance (MR) or x-ray. In such a dual imaging approach, while the correlation between optical and anatomical images may be high, it is not perfect. For example, a tumour may be present in the optical image, but may not be discernable in the anatomical image. The proposed hierarchical Bayesian approach allows incorporation of partial a priori knowledge about the noise and unknown optical image models, thereby capturing the function-anatomy correlation effectively. We present a computationally efficient iterative algorithm to simultaneously estimate the optical image and the unknown a priori model parameters. Extensive numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed method avoids undesirable bias towards anatomical prior information and leads to significantly improved spatial resolution and quantitative accuracy.},

	abstract = {Integrins mediate many biological processes, including tumor-induced angiogenesis and metastasis. The arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) peptide sequence is a common recognition motif by integrins in many proteins and small peptides. While evaluating a small library of RGD peptides for imaging alpha(V)beta(3) integrin (ABI)-positive tumor cell line (A549) by optical methods, we discovered that conjugating a presumably inactive linear hexapeptide GRDSPK with a near-infrared carbocyanine molecular probe (Cypate) yielded a previously undescribed bioactive ligand (Cyp-GRD) that targets ABI-positive tumors. MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] assay with A549 cells showed that Cyp-GRD was not cytotoxic up to 100 muM in cell culture. The compound was internalized by cells, and this internalization was blocked by coincubation with a cyclic RGD peptide (cyclo[RGDfV], f is d-phenylalanine) that binds ABI with high affinity. In vivo, Cyp-GRD selectively accumulated in tumors relative to surrounding normal tissues. Blocking studies with cyclo[RGDfV] inhibited the in vivo uptake of Cyp-GRD, suggesting that both compounds target the same active site of the protein. A strong correlation between the Cyp-GRD peptide and mitochondrial NADH concentration suggests that the new molecule could also report on the metabolic status of cells ex vivo. Interestingly, neither a Cypate-labeled linear RGD peptide nor an (111)In-labeled DOTA-GRD conjugate was selectively retained in the tumor. These results clearly demonstrate the synergistic effects of Cypate and GRD peptide for molecular recognition of integrin expression and suggest the potential of using carbocyanines as optical scaffolds for designing biologically active molecules.},

Relative muscle oxygen consumption (rVO2) was also computed from these data. Diffuse correlation spectroscopy provides information about blood flow, and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy provides information about blood oxygenation. Ten healthy subjects and one patient with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) were studied during 3-min arterial cuff occlusion of arm and leg, and during 1-min plantar flexion exercise. Signals from different layers (cutaneous tissues and muscles) during cuff occlusion were differentiated, revealing strong hemodynamic responses from muscle layers. During exercise in healthy legs, the observed approximately 4.7 fold increase in relative blood flow (rBF) was significantly lower than the corresponding increase in rVO2 (approximately 7 fold). The magnitudes of rBF and rVO2 during exercise in the PAD patient were approximately 1/2 of the healthy controls, and the StO2 recovery time was twice that of the controls. The hybrid instrument improves upon current technologies for measuring muscle responses by simultaneously measuring rBF and StO2. The instrument thus provides a method for evaluation of microcirculation and muscle metabolism in patients with vascular diseases.},

Eleven regularly weight-trained males (20.8 +/- 1.3 years; 96.2 +/- 14.4 kg, 182.4 +/- 7.3 cm) underwent 4 sets of squat exercise on 3 separate occasions that differed in both exercise intensity and volume. During each testing session, subjects performed either 15 repetitions.set(-1) at 60\% of 1 repetition maximum (1RM) (L), 10 repetitions.set(-1) at 75\% of 1RM (M), or 4 repetitions.set(-1) at 90\% of 1RM (H). During each exercise, Vo(2) and HR were measured before (PRE), immediately post (IP), and at 10 (10P), 20 (20P) 30 (30P), and 40 (40P) minutes postexercise. The [La] was measured at PRE, IP, 20P, and 40P. Decrease in HR (DeltaHR) was determined by subtracting HR at 10P from that at IP, whereas decrease in [La] (Delta[La]) was computed by subtracting [La] at 20P from that at IP. A significant correlation (p {\textless} 0.05) was found between Vo(2)max and DeltaHR in all exercise conditions. A significant correlation (p {\textless} 0.05) was also found between Vo(2)max and Delta[La] in L and M but not in H. The Vo(2) was higher (p {\textless} 0.05) during M than H at IP and 10P, while no difference was seen between L and M and between L and H. These results indicate that those with greater aerobic capacity tend to have a greater reduction in HR and [La] during recovery from resistance exercise. In addition, an exercise routine performed at low to moderate intensity coupled with a moderate to high exercise volume is most effective in maximizing caloric expenditure following resistance exercise.},

Recent developments in molecular beacons offer a way to selectively tag various precancer and cancer signatures and provide high tumor-to-background contrast. Near-infrared imaging can deeply probe tissue up to a couple of centimeters; thus, it possesses the potential for noninvasive detection of breast or lymph node cancer. A phase cancellation (in- and antiphase) device is used to increase the sensitivity in detecting fluorescent photons and the accuracy of tumor localization. The optoelectronic system consists of the laser diode sources, fiber optics, interference filter (to select the fluorescent photons), and the high-sensitivity photon detector (photomultiplier tube). The source-detector pair scans the tissue surface in multiple directions, and the localization image can be obtained by angular back-projection reconstruction. Simulations and experimental data demonstrated the feasibility of detection and localization offluorescent object embedded inside the highly scattering media. Tumor-bearing mouse model with injection of fluorescent contrast agents is used to simulate the human breast tumor labeled with molecular beacons. The system can detect fluorescent contrast agents as small as one nanomole at the depth of three centimeters, with a three-millimeter localization error. This instrument has the potential for tumor diagnosis and imaging, and the accuracy of the localization suggests that this system could help guide the clinical fine-needle biopsy. Also, this portable device would be complementary to x-ray mammography and provide add-on information on early diagnosis and localization of breast tumor.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: This study evaluated heterogeneity of muscle O2 dynamics in a single muscle during bicycle exercise using an eight-channel near-infrared continuous wave spectroscopy (NIRcws) mapping system.
METHODS: Nine healthy subjects performed bicycle exercise at fixed workloads of 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100\% maximal workload for 5 min at each level. Muscle oxygenation in the vastus lateralis (VL) during and after each exercise was monitored using the NIRcws mapping system. Pulmonary O2 uptake and heart rate were monitored continuously during the experiment. Blood samples were taken to measure blood lactate concentration at 30 s after each exercise stage.
RESULTS: Half time reoxygenation, the time taken to reach a value of half-maximal recovery, was significantly delayed in distal sites compared with proximal sites of VL. Conversely, muscle deoxygenation for all measurement sites increased incrementally with higher exercise workloads, and no significant difference of deoxygenation level showed within each channel. However, relative dispersion of muscle deoxygenation during exercise significantly decreased when the workload increased. Moreover, relative dispersion of muscle deoxygenation between the subjects also decreased with an increase in the workload.
CONCLUSION: Muscle deoxygenation in a single muscle was more heterogeneous at lower exercise workloads, and variations of the muscle deoxygenation heterogeneity between subjects were greater at lower exercise workloads.},

Near-infrared (NIR)-emissive polymersomes (50-nm- to 50-microm-diameter polymer vesicles) were generated through cooperative self assembly of amphiphilic diblock copolymers and conjugated multi(porphyrin)-based NIR fluorophores (NIRFs). When compared with natural vesicles comprised of phospholipids, polymersomes were uniquely capable of incorporating and uniformly distributing numerous large hydrophobic NIRFs exclusively in their lamellar membranes. Within these sequestered compartments, long polymer chains regulate the mean fluorophore-fluorophore interspatial separation as well as the fluorophore-localized electronic environment. Porphyrin-based NIRFs manifest photophysical properties within the polymersomal matrix akin to those established for these high-emission dipole strength fluorophores in organic solvents, thereby yielding uniquely emissive vesicles. Furthermore, the total fluorescence emanating from the assemblies gives rise to a localized optical signal of sufficient intensity to penetrate through the dense tumor tissue of a live animal. Robust NIR-emissive polymersomes thus define a soft matter platform with exceptional potential to facilitate deep-tissue fluorescence-based imaging for in vivo diagnostic and drug-delivery applications.},

STUDY DESIGN: The instrument has 3 wavelength light-emitting diodes (735, 805, and 850 nm) as light sources and a photomultiplier tube as a detector. This instrument was used in 6 pregnant women ({\textgreater}36 weeks of gestation). First, a fetal heart rate was obtained with a fetal heart rate monitor. Then, the depth of fetal tissue (head) from the maternal abdomen was determined by ultrasound examination; the distance between the optodes (light source and the detector) was set to be approximately twice the depth of the fetus (7-11 cm). The data analysis was based on the modified Beer-Lambert law and the use of optical densities at 735 and 850 nm to obtain the concentration changes of the oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin. The saturation was expressed as the percent of oxygen saturation equal to 100 x oxyhemoglobin/(oxyhemoglobin + deoxyhemoglobin). We recorded the spectroscopy data and the fetal heart rate for approximately 3 to 10 minutes in each patient.
RESULTS: The mean oxygen saturation values of each of the 6 individual fetuses ranged from 50\% to 74\% (overall mean saturation, 61\% +/- 14.8\% [SD]).
CONCLUSION: This preliminary data indicate that transabdominal fetal pulse oximetry is feasible for human patient application. The measured values were similar to those that are obtained with transvaginal pulse oximetry. Future studies should correlate transabdominally obtained measurements with those measurements that are obtained by transvaginal fetal pulse oximetry.},

	abstract = {Far red and near infrared (NIR) light promotes wound healing, but the mechanism is poorly understood. Our previous studies using 670 nm light-emitting diode (LED) arrays suggest that cytochrome c oxidase, a photoacceptor in the NIR range, plays an important role in therapeutic photobiomodulation. If this is true, then an irreversible inhibitor of cytochrome c oxidase, potassium cyanide (KCN), should compete with LED and reduce its beneficial effects. This hypothesis was tested on primary cultured neurons. LED treatment partially restored enzyme activity blocked by 10-100 microm KCN. It significantly reduced neuronal cell death induced by 300 microm KCN from 83.6 to 43.5\%. However, at 1-100 mm KCN, the protective effects of LED decreased, and neuronal deaths increased. LED significantly restored neuronal ATP content only at 10 microm KCN but not at higher concentrations of KCN tested. Pretreatment with LED enhanced efficacy of LED during exposure to 10 or 100 microm KCN but did not restore enzyme activity to control levels. In contrast, LED was able to completely reverse the detrimental effect of tetrodotoxin, which only indirectly down-regulated enzyme levels. Among the wavelengths tested (670, 728, 770, 830, and 880 nm), the most effective ones (830 nm, 670 nm) paralleled the NIR absorption spectrum of oxidized cytochrome c oxidase, whereas the least effective wavelength, 728 nm, did not. The results are consistent with our hypothesis that the mechanism of photobiomodulation involves the up-regulation of cytochrome c oxidase, leading to increased energy metabolism in neurons functionally inactivated by toxins.},

Easy methods for assessing glucose utilization in vitro and in vivo should find widespread application in biological and biomedical studies, as illustrated by the adoption of FDG PET imaging in medicine. We have recently synthesized a new NIR fluorescent pyropheophorbide conjugate of 2-deoxyglucose (2DG), Pyro-2DG, as a GLUT-targeted photosensitizer. In this study, we have evaluated the in vivo uptake of Pyro-2DG and found that Pyro-2DG selectively accumulated in two tumor models, 9L glioma in the rat and c-MYC-induced mammary tumor in the mouse, compared to surrounding normal muscle tissues at a ratio of about 10:1. By simultaneously performing redox ratio and fluorescence imaging, a high degree of correlation between the PN/(Fp+PN) redox ratio, where PN denotes reduced pyridine nucleotides (NADH) and Fp denotes oxidized flavoproteins, and the Pyro-2DG uptake was found in both murine tumor models, indicating that Pyro-2DG could serve as an extrinsic NIR fluorescent metabolic index for the tumors. The fact that only a low level of correlation was observed between the redox ratio and the uptake of Pyro-acid (the free fluorophore without the 2-deoxyglucose moiety) supports the hypothesis that Pyro-2DG is an index of the mitochondrial status (extent of PN reduction) of a tumor.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The mitochondrion acts as a pivotal decision center in many types of apoptotic responses. To clarify the effects of the enhanced mitochondrial function on tumor necrosis factoralpha (TNFalpha)-induced apoptosis, we studied hepatic injuries in transgenic mice whose livers express creatine kinase (CK).
METHODS: Mice fed a diet containing 10\% creatine, came to accumulate phosphocreatine and to enhance hepatic ATP levels and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation activities. TNFalpha-mediated hepatic apoptosis in normally fed and Cr-feeding CK transgenic mice were assessed.
RESULTS: TNFalpha and actinomycin D cause severe liver failure in normally fed transgenic mice, and in the wild-type mice. In contrast, no significant elevations in transaminase levels after injection were observed in Cr feeding transgenic mice. The disruption of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential at 2 h after TNFalpha injection, prior to ATP depletion, activation of caspase 3 like protease, and DNA fragmentation at 4-6 h after injection, were observed in normally fed transgenic mice. These were fully suppressed in Cr feeding transgenic mice. However, anti-Fas antibody-induced apoptosis was not inhibited in both groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that TNFalpha-induced apoptosis was inhibited in CK transgenic mice livers by maintaining mitochondrial function.},

This is determined from the redox ratio changes derived from the intrinsic oxidized flavoprotein (Fp) and reduced pyridine nucleotide (PN) [i.e., reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH)] fluorescence signals observed using a cryoimager. Thus, the redox ratio is a sensitive indicator for providing reliable and informative measurements of PDT-induced tissue damage.

	abstract = {RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to define and characterize carbocyanine labeled low-density lipoprotein (LDL) to be used in the optical imaging of LDL receptor (LDLr)-overexpressing tumor models.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI) was used to label LDL (DiI-LDL). Scatchard plots were generated to determine the maximum binding capacity B(max) and dissociation constants K(D) of DiI-LDL in B16 melanoma (B16) and hepatoblastoma G(2) (HepG(2)) cell lines. Selective uptake of DiI-LDL into both tumor cells and corresponding subcutaneous tumors in mice were demonstrated by confocal microscopy and three-dimensional Cryo-imaging, respectively.
RESULTS: The labeling efficiency of DiI-LDL was 61 ng DiI/microg LDL protein (34 mol DiI/mol LDL protein). B(max) and K(D) for B16 cells were 6.311 ng LDL/mg cell protein and 60.38 microg protein/mL (117 nM), respectively. B(max) and K(D) were 7.573 ng LDL/mg cell protein and 26.79 microg protein/mL (52 nM) for HepG(2) cells, respectively. Confocal microscopic images showed specific uptake of DiI-LDL throughout the cytoplasm in the B16/HepG(2) cells. Cryo-imaging demonstrated preferential accumulations of DiI-LDL in the viable tumor regions of both B16 and HepG(2) tumors compared with their adjacent normal tissues and corresponding necrotic tumor regions. In addition, uptake of DiI-LDL by the HepG(2) tumor was much higher than that of the B16 tumor, consistent with the fact that the probe binding affinity for LDLrs of HepG(2) cells is 2.3 times that of B16 cells.
CONCLUSION: This study suggested that carbocyanine labeled LDL could be used for optical imaging of tumors overexpressing LDLr.},

Cp administered i.p. at a dose of 300 mg/kg caused a significant drop in glycolytic rate 24 h after treatment (P {\textless} 0.01). This drop was accompanied by an increase in [C-3]/[C-4] glutamate ratio in perchloric acid extracts of the tumors, indicating an increase in the Kreb's cycle activity.

Increases in NADH levels were also observed in rapidly frozen excised tumors examined by three-dimensional optical redox scanning.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The mechanisms that underlie the affect of acute program variables on muscle growth and strength development for strength/power athletes have been of great interest. This investigation examined the affects of two different resistance exercise protocols on muscle oxygenation, and the anabolic hormonal response to such exercise.
METHODS: Eleven experienced resistance-trained male athletes performed four sets of the squat exercise using either a low-intensity, high-volume (LI; 15 repetitions at 60\% one-repetition maximum [1-RM]) or high-intensity, low-volume (HI; 4 repetitions at 90\% 1-RM) load. Venous blood samples were obtained before (Pre), immediate (IP), 20- (20P), and 40-min (40P) postexercise. Continuous-wave near-infrared spectroscopy was used to measure oxygen desaturation during exercise.
RESULTS: No differences in muscle deoxygenation were seen between LI and HI. However, time-dependent postexercise reoxygenation was significantly different between the two exercise sessions (35.3 +/- 17.4 s vs 24.5 +/- 14.3 s in LI and HI, respectively). Testosterone and growth hormone (GH) concentrations were significantly elevated from Pre at IP, 20P, and 40P in both LI and HI. GH concentrations were higher (P{\textless}0.05) for LI than at HI at 20P and 40P.
CONCLUSION: Muscle oxygen recovery kinetics appeared to be influenced by differences in the intensity and volume of exercise, and delayed reoxygenation appears to affect the GH response to exercise.},

Fascicle length, fascicle angle, NIR-O(2) saturation (deoxygenated Hb or oxygenated Hb), and NIR-blood volume (sum of deoxygenated and oxygenated Hb) were obtained in the distal and proximal portions of the GM at rest and during contraction. Exercise consisted of 2 min of standing plantar flexion at 1 Hz with an additional load of 50\% of each subject's weight. Plantar flexion produced larger decreases (Delta: difference between rest and exercise values) in NIR-O(2) saturation [mean saturation (SD) of 0.14 (0.05) vs 0.07 (0.04) optical density units] and NIR-blood volume [mean saturation (SD) of -0.23 (0.08) vs -0.13 (0.04) optical density units] in the distal compared with the proximal portion ( P{\textless}0.05 for all comparisons).

We used an intermittent isometric exercise at high intensity, which elicits a spontaneous occlusion of the blood flow to the muscle due to an increase in intramuscular pressure. Changes in muscle oxygenation and phosphocreatine (PCr) concentration were monitored in 5 subjects during an intermittent isometric exercise (5 sec. contraction/5 sec. relaxation) at 50\% of maximum voluntary contraction for 3 minutes. The rate of deoxygenation was measured from the 2nd sec. to the 3rd sec. of each muscle contraction. The rate of deoxygenation at the onset of exercise followed an exponential time course with a time constant of 42.0 +/- 12.5 sec. (mean +/- SD). This value agreed with the time constant of the decrease in PCr (48.2 +/- 10.2 sec.). This result suggests that m-VO2 was successfully monitored with a time resolution of 10 sec. by NIRS during exercise without arterial occlusion.},

	abstract = {Since local hyperthermia (HT) affects microenvironmental parameters, the aim of the study was to analyze the impact of 42 degrees C-HT on microcirculatory function, tumor pO2, microregional redox status and ATP distribution in experimental rat tumors. Subcutaneously growing DS-sarcomas were treated with localized HT using infrared-A radiation resulting in a mean tumor temperature of 42 degrees C. The relative red blood cell (RBC) flux in the tumor was assessed using the laser Doppler technique and the mean tumor pO2 measured continuously using O2-sensitive catheter electrodes. In a second series of experiments, the microregional distribution of the mitochondrial redox status and ATP concentration was measured. Although the average RBC flux increased by 63\%, tumor pO2 rose only by approx. 6\%. No distinct changes were seen in the mitochondrial redox status. The microregional distribution of the redox status as well as of the ATP concentration showed considerable heterogeneity. In conclusion, although 42 degrees C-HT leads to a distinct improvement in tumor perfusion, there is practically no change in the oxygenation status. The latter finding can be explained by an equivalent increase in the oxygen consumption rate of the cells which increases by approx. 58\% at 42 degrees C compared to normothermia.},

This contribution reports on the calibration of the instrument in model systems and the use of the instrument to measure tissue saturation (StO2) in a small animal model. In addition, a global interpretation of the meaning of tissue oxygen has been formulated based on the idea that autoregulation will maintain tissue oxygen at a fixed value over a range of arterial and venous oxygen values over the range of autoregulation. Beyond that range, the tissue oxygen is still correctly measured but, as expected, approaches the arterial saturation at low metabolic rates and the venous saturation at high metabolic rates of mitochondria.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of hypoxic training on the cardiorespiratory system and skeletal muscle among well-trained endurance athletes in a randomized cross-over design. METHODS: Eight junior national level competitive cyclists were separated into two groups; Group A trained under normoxic condition (21\% O2) for 2 hours/day, 3 days/week for 3 weeks while Group B used the same training protocol under hypoxic condition (15\% O2). After 3 weeks of each initial training condition, five weeks of self-training under usual field conditions intervened before the training condition was switched from NT to HT in Group A, from HT to NT in Group B. The subjects were tested at sea level before and after each training period. O2 uptake (O2), blood samples, and muscle deoxygenation were measured during bicycle exercise test. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: No changes in maximal workload, arterial O2 content, O2 at lactate threshold and O2max were observed before or after each training period. In contrast, deoxygenation change during submaximal exercise in the vastus lateralis was significantly higher at HT than NT (p {\textless} 0.01). In addition, half time of oxygenation recovery was significantly faster after HT (13.2 PlusMinus; 2.6 sec) than NT (18.8 PlusMinus; 2.7 sec) (p {\textless} 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Three weeks of HT may not give an additional performance benefit at sea level for elite competitive cyclists, even though HT may induce some physiological adaptations on muscle tissue level.},

Upon its photoactivation, we demonstrate that this agent efficiently causes selective mitochondrial damage to the region of a tumor that was photoirradiated after administration of this agent, but does not affect tissues photoirradiated in the absence of the agent or tissues treated with the agent that are not photoirradiated. Preliminary confocal microscopy studies suggest that Pyro-2DG is delivered and trapped in tumor cells via the GLUT/hexokinase pathway and therefore is useful both as a tumor-targeted NIR fluorescence imaging probe and as a PDT agent for the destruction of cancer.},

In our protocol an extrinsic contrast agent, Indocyanine Green (ICG), was injected by bolus. Three clinical scenarios with three different pathologies were investigated. A two-compartment model was used to analyze the pharmacokinetics of ICG and preprocess the data, and diffuse optical tomography was used for imaging. Localization and delineation of the tumor was achieved in good agreement with a priori information. Moreover, different dynamical features were observed for differing pathologies. The malignant cases exhibited slower rate constants (uptake and outflow) compared to healthy tissue.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cellular functions are maintained by a continuous supply of ATP, which is supplied efficiently by mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Since myoglobin, found in cardiac myocytes and red skeletal muscle, but not in the liver, facilitates oxygen diffusion under low oxygen conditions and enhances oxidative phosphorylation, this study seeks to enhance hepatic ATP levels and attenuate ischemia-reperfusion injury in rodent livers by adenovirus-mediated myoglobin expression.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: After infecting Hep3B and rodent livers with adenovirus carrying CMV promoter sequences linked to the human myoglobin gene (AdCMVMyo), reverse transcriptase-PCR and immunodetection for myoglobin, and cellular and hepatic ATP levels were examined. The effect of myoglobin was evaluated in a hepatic ischemia-reperfusion model in the rat.
RESULTS: Myoglobin expression was confirmed in Hep3B and rat livers after AdCMVMyo infection. The ATP levels in Hep3B cells and C57BL/6 mice livers 72 h after AdCMVMyo transfection were significantly higher than control levels and those after adenovirus-mediated beta-galactosidase transfection. Finally, expression of myoglobin attenuated ischemia-reperfusion injury in the rat liver.
CONCLUSION: These results indicate that myoglobin gene transfer to the liver enhanced ATP levels both in vitro and in vivo and might be a novel strategy to reduce ischemia-reperfusion injury.},

Cr supplementation produced a 11.5 +/- 4.6\% increase in the resting muscle phosphocreatine (PCr) concentration and a 65.0 +/- 4.2\% increase in the PCr degradation during Ex10. ATP synthesis rate through PCr hydrolysis and total anaerobic ATP synthesis rate during Ex10 increased from 0.64 +/- 0.08 (pre-value) to 0.86 +/- 0.14 mmol/kg ww/sec (post-value, p {\textless} 0.05) and from 0.97 +/- 0.16 (pre-value) to 1.33 +/- 0.27 mmol/kg ww/sec (post-value, p {\textless} 0.05), respectively. An increase in total anaerobic ATP synthesis during Ex10 after Cr supplementation positively correlated with the increase in ATP synthesis through PCr hydrolysis. Cr supplementation produced a 15.1 +/- 3.8\% increase in the mean power output during Ex10. There was no significant difference in the mean power output per unit of total anaerobic ATP synthesis during Ex10 between before and after Cr supplementation. ATP synthesis rate through PCr hydrolysis positively correlated with mean power output during Ex10 in all twelve subjects after treatment (r = 0.58, p {\textless} 0.05). The results suggest that Cr supplementation enhanced PCr degradation during Ex10. It is strongly indicated that an improvement in performance during Ex10 was associated with the increased PCr availability for the synthesis of ATP.},

	abstract = {We hypothesized that after maximal short-term isometric exercise, when O(2) demand is still high and O(2) supply is not fully activated, higher oxidative capacity muscle may exhibit slower muscle reoxygenation after the exercise than low oxidative capacity muscle. Seven healthy male subjects performed a maximal voluntary isometric handgrip exercise for 10 s. The reoxygenation rate after the exercise (Reoxy-rate) in the finger flexor muscle was determined by near infrared continuous wave spectroscopy (NIRcws) while phosphocreatine (PCr) was measured simultaneously by (31)P magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Muscle oxygen consumption (muscle VO(2)) and muscle oxidative capacity were evaluated using the rate of PCr resynthesis post-exercise. The forearm blood flow (FBF) index at the end of exercise was measured using NIRcws. There was a significant positive correlation between the Reoxy-rate, which ranged between 0.53\% s(-1) and 12.47\% s(-1), and the time constant for PCr resynthesis, which ranged between 17.8 s and 38.3 s (r(2)=0.939, P{\textless}0.001). At the end of the exercise, muscle VO(2) exceeded the resting level by approximately 25-fold, while the FBF index exceeded the resting level by only 3-fold on average. The Reoxy-rate closely correlated with muscle VO(2) (r(2)=0.727, P{\textless}0.05), but not with the FBF index. Also, the estimated O(2) balance (muscle VO(2) index/FBF index) was negatively correlated with the Reoxy-rate (r(2)=0.820, P{\textless}0.001). These results support our hypothesis that higher oxidative capacity muscle shows slower muscle reoxygenation after maximal short-term isometric exercise because the Reoxy-rate after this type of exercise may be influenced more by muscle VO(2) than by O(2) supply.},

	volume = {510},
	issn = {0065-2598},
	abstract = {Continued studies in cognitive function in problem solving of graded difficulties has now proceeded through several thousand tests of high school students in a six-week period last summer (2000). The optical imager used 9 sources and 23 detectors operated in time multiplex to give an image of the prefrontal region in several seconds. Thus, the image can be acquired in the state prior to activation, during and following activation. The images are acquired at two wavelengths, 750 and 850 nm, from which the changes of blood concentration (blood pooling) and relative oxygenation/deoxygenation state (metabolic activity) can be obtained and with suitable calibrations converted into micromolar changes of total Hb concentration and fractional oxygenation, respectively. The imager has a wearable pad applied to the forehead and the electronics now presents the running average of the two quantities mentioned above in the 16 voxels which cover the prefrontal region in 1 sec. Thus the protocol involves a scanning through anagrams of graded difficulty which are known to include the range of maximal activation ({\textgreater}3 solutions in the 30 sec test interval or are too easy ({\textgreater}10), or too difficult. Anagrams are presented in a sequence of three, four, five, etc. letter anagrams to the maximal level of difficulty and then back down again to the starting point. Each anagram is displayed for approximately one minute. Computer scanning of the results gives histograms of the several hundred tests per individual in the "training" interval (for three weeks) and in the post training interval about 400 tests, each for 4 levels of difficulty (3 weeks). Usually two or three complete trials per day were achieved with the result that the group of 7 students produced over 2600 test results in 2000. The histogram displays are under study to determine: a) the most fruitful voxels, b) the fraction of the total tests that appeared in those voxels, and c) the maximum signal level observed in the histogram display in units of micromolar hemoglobin. The product of these two was taken as the Figure of Merit and their displays of the 16 voxels gave patterns for trained and untrained responses. The preliminary conclusions of this study were: a) that the training effect was very large, pretraining exhibited a chaotic voxel distribution for all difficulty levels while trained students gave a higher output and activated only one or two of the 16 voxels. If the tests were too easy, too hard, i.e., an ability/difficulty mismatch, frustration or disattention gave similar chaotic patterns (7); b) a match between difficulty and ability activated only a few voxels in similar locations. Since attention and success measures appear to be of interest in school room studies, a wearable imager with local LCD display can be supplied to the Senior class of the local high school for those individuals who have already had last Summer's training in anagrams. A wearable NIR measurement of metabolic activation and blood flow may be a useful educational aid. In summary, the optical method focuses attention on cognition activated oxygenation of prefrontal cortex.},

Fourteen patients were studied with a MR-NIR prototype imager and spectrometer. A diffuse optical tomographic scheme employed the MR images as a priori information to implement an image-guided NIR localized spectroscopic scheme. All patients who entered the study also underwent gadolinium-enhanced MRI and biopsy so that the optical findings were cross-validated with MR readings and histopathology. The technique quantified the oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin of five malignant and nine benign breast lesions in vivo. Breast cancers were found with decreased oxygen saturation and higher blood concentration than most benign lesions. The average hemoglobin concentration ([H]) of cancers was 0.130+/-0.100 mM, and the average hemoglobin saturation (Y) was 60+/-9\% compared to [H]=0.018+/-0.005 mM and Y=69+/-6\% of background tissue. Fibroadenomas exhibited high hemoglobin concentration [H]=0.060+/-0.010 mM and mild decrease in oxygen saturation Y=67+/-2\%. Cysts and other normal lesions were easily differentiated based on intrinsic contrast information. This novel optical technology can be a significant add-on in MR examinations and can be used to characterize functional parameters of cancers with diagnostic and treatment prognosis potential. It is foreseen that the technique can play a major role in functional activation studies of brain and muscle as well.},

We have used noninvasive continuous near infrared muscle spectroscopy (NIRS) to investigate the delivery and utilization of oxygen in response to exercise in this disorder. Patients performed an incremental treadmill walking protocol in which levels of muscle deoxygenation or oxygenation were continuously measured in the medial calf muscle. The kinetics of recovery from exercise-induced deoxygenation, called the half-time of recovery (t(1/2)) were determined. The t(1/2) was prolonged in patients with Friedreich's ataxia compared with controls, and the degree of prolongation correlated with the length of the shorter GAA repeat, a genetic measure that correlates with the age of onset of disease. The t(1/2) also correlated inversely with patient age and with the maximum treadmill speed attained. Several patients also displayed features consistent with inadequate oxygen utilization by muscle. These results suggest that NIRS may be an effective tool for monitoring the biochemical and functional features of Friedreich's ataxia in parallel.},

	volume = {49},

	doi = {10.1002/lsm.22655},
	abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Improvements in skin appearance resulting from treatment with fractionated picosecond-lasers have been noted, but optimizing the treatment efficacy depends on a thorough understanding of the specific skin response. The development of non-invasive laser imaging techniques in conjunction with laser therapy can potentially provide feedback for guidance and optimizing clinical outcome.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the capability of multiphoton microscopy (MPM), a high-resolution, label-free imaging technique, to characterize in vivo the skin response to a fractionated non-ablative picosecond-laser treatment.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Two areas on the arm of a volunteer were treated with a fractionated picosecond laser at the Dermatology Clinic, UC Irvine. The skin response to treatment was imaged in vivo with a clinical MPM-based tomograph at 3 hours and 24 hours after treatment and seven additional time points over a 4-week period.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: MPM revealed micro-injuries present in the epidermis. Pigmented cells were particularly damaged in the process, suggesting that melanin is likely the main absorber for laser induced optical breakdown.
RESULTS: Damaged individual cells were distinguished as early as 3 hours post pico-laser treatment with the 532 nm wavelength, and 24 hours post-treatment with both 532 and 1064 nm wavelengths. At later time points, clusters of cellular necrotic debris were imaged across the treated epidermis. After 24 hours of treatment, inflammatory cells were imaged in the proximity of epidermal micro-injuries. The epidermal injuries were exfoliated over a 4-week period.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This observational and descriptive pilot study demonstrates that in vivo MPM imaging can be used non-invasively to provide label-free contrast for describing changes in human skin following a fractionated non-ablative laser treatment. The results presented in this study represent the groundwork for future longitudinal investigations on an expanded number of subjects to understand the response to treatment in different skin types with different laser parameters, critical factors in optimizing treatment outcome.

	abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) are diagnosed by clinical evaluation, which can include dermoscopic evaluation, biopsy, and histopathologic examination. Recent translation of multiphoton microscopy (MPM) to clinical practice raises the possibility of noninvasive, label-free in vivo imaging of BCCs that could reduce the time from consultation to treatment.
OBJECTIVES: To demonstrate the capability of MPM to image in vivo BCC lesions in human skin, and to evaluate if histopathologic criteria can be identified in MPM images.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Imaging in patients with BCC was performed at the University of California-Irvine Health Beckman Laser Institute \& Medical Clinic, Irvine, between September 2012 and April 2014, with a clinical MPM-based tomograph. Ten BCC lesions were imaged in vivo in 9 patients prior to biopsy. The MPM images were compared with histopathologic findings.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: MPM imaging identified in vivo and noninvasively the main histopathologic feature of BCC lesions: nests of basaloid cells showing palisading in the peripheral cell layer at the dermoepidermal junction and/or in the dermis.
RESULTS: The main MPM feature associated with the BCC lesions involved nests of basaloid cells present in the papillary and reticular dermis. This feature correlated well with histopathologic examination. Other MPM features included elongated tumor cells in the epidermis aligned in 1 direction and parallel collagen and elastin bundles surrounding the tumors.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study demonstrates, in a limited patient population, that noninvasive in vivo MPM imaging can provide label-free contrast that reveals several characteristic features of BCC lesions. Future studies are needed to validate the technique and correlate MPM performance with histopathologic examination.},

Current standard diagnosis is based on biopsy and histopathologic examination, a method that is invasive and highly dependent upon physician experience. In this work, we used a clinical multiphoton microscope to image in vivo and noninvasively melanocytic nevi at three different stages: common nevi without dysplastic changes, dysplastic nevi with structural and architectural atypia, and melanoma. We analyzed multiphoton microscopy (MPM) images corresponding to 15 lesions (five in each group) both qualitatively and quantitatively. For the qualitative analysis, we identified the morphologic features characteristic of each group. MPM images corresponding to dysplastic nevi and melanoma were compared with standard histopathology to determine correlations between tissue constituents and morphology and to evaluate whether standard histopathology criteria can be identified in the MPM images. Prominent qualitative correlations included the morphology of epidermal keratinocytes, the appearance of nests of nevus cells surrounded by collagen fibers, and the structure of the epidermal-dermal junction. For the quantitative analysis, we defined a numerical multiphoton melanoma index (MMI) based on three-dimensional in vivo image analysis that scores signals derived from two-photon excited fluorescence, second harmonic generation, and melanocyte morphology features on a continuous 9-point scale. Indices corresponding to common nevi (0-1), dysplastic nevi (1-4), and melanoma (5-8) were significantly different (P {\textless} 0.05), suggesting the potential of the method to distinguish between melanocytic nevi in vivo.},

	abstract = {We employ a clinical multiphoton microscope to monitor in vivo and noninvasively the changes in reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) fluorescence of human epidermal cells during arterial occlusion. We correlate these results with measurements of tissue oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin concentration during oxygen deprivation using spatial frequency domain imaging. During arterial occlusion, a decrease in oxyhemoglobin corresponds to an increase in NADH fluorescence in the basal epidermal cells, implying a reduction in basal cell oxidative phosphorylation. The ischemia-induced oxygen deprivation is associated with a strong increase in NADH fluorescence of keratinocytes in layers close to the stratum basale, whereas keratinocytes from epidermal layers closer to the skin surface are not affected. Spatial frequency domain imaging optical property measurements, combined with a multilayer Monte Carlo-based radiative transport model of multiphoton microscopy signal collection in skin, establish that localized tissue optical property changes during occlusion do not impact the observed NADH signal increase. This outcome supports the hypothesis that the vascular contribution to the basal layer oxygen supply is significant and these cells engage in oxidative metabolism. Keratinocytes in the more superficial stratum granulosum are either supplied by atmospheric oxygen or are functionally anaerobic. Based on combined hemodynamic and two-photon excited fluorescence data, the oxygen consumption rate in the stratum basale is estimated to be ∼0.035 μmoles/10(6) cells/h.},

	abstract = {Photostress has to be considered during optical micromanipulation of gametes. Ultraviolet light, including low-energy UVA (32-400 nm) radiation, as well as high-intensity near infrared (NIR) laser radiation may induce cell damage. A total number of 580 light-exposed sperm cells were studied in single-cell photostress experiments. Low-power (1.5 mW, 5.3 W/cm2) UVA exposure with 365 nm radiation of a standard mercury microscopy lamp to human spermatozoa resulted within 109 +/- 30 s in paralysis and within 310 +/- 110 s in cell death. Cytotoxic effects during cell manipulation with laser microbeams were found to be partly based on non-linear excitation phenomena, in particular two-photon absorption by endogenous cell chromophores. Two-photon absorption will be more intense in the case of pulsed laser microradiation, but occur also during micromanipulation with highly focused continuous wave (cw) microbeams used as laser tweezers ('optical traps'). In particular, short-wavelength NIR traps {\textless} 800 nm induce UVA-like biological effects (oxidative stress). For example, sperm trapping with 760 nm microbeams resulted in UVA-like autofluorescence modifications, paralysis within 35 +/- 20 s and cell death within 65 +/- 20 s. In contrast, laser microbeams at 800-1064 nm may act as relatively safe micromanipulation tools. In most optical traps multifrequency cw lasers are employed. Radiation of these lasers can magnify cytotoxic effects. Therefore, single-frequency laser operation should be preferred. In general, laser assisted cell micromanipulation requires a new understanding of microbeam-cell interaction, including aspects of non-linear optics.},

Prior to trapping, Chinese hamster ovary cells exhibited weak UVA-excited autofluorescence with maxima at 455 nm characteristic of beta-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate) emission. No strong effect of a 1064 nm NIR microbeam on fluorescence intensity and spectral characteristics was found during trapping, even for power densities up to 70 MW/cm2 and radiant exposures of 100 GJ/cm2. In contrast to the 1064 nm trap, a 760 nm trapping beam caused a two-fold autofluorescence increase within 5 min (about 20 GJ/cm2). Exposure to 365 nm UVA (1 W/cm2) during 1064 nm trapping significantly altered cellular autofluorescence, causing, within 10 min, a five-fold increase and a 6 nm red shift versus initial levels. We conclude that 1064 nm microbeams can be applied for an extended period without producing autofluorescence changes characteristic of alterations in the cellular redox state. However, 760 nm effects may occur via a two-photon absorption mechanism, which, in a manner similar to UVA exposure, alters the redox balance and places the cell in a state of oxidative stress.},

Excitation radiation from a tunable Ti-sapphire laser, focused through high-numerical-aperture microscope optics, provided diffraction-limited microbeams of an adjustable peak power. Laser scanning NIR microscopy was used to detect spatially the intracellular distribution of fluorescent coenzymes by fluorescence intensity imaging as well as fluorescence lifetime imaging (tau-mapping). Upon the onset of UV or NIR exposure, Chinese hamster ovary cells exhibited blue/green autofluorescence with a mean lifetime of 2.2 ns, which was attributed to NAD(P)H in mitochondria. Exposure to 365 nm radiation from a high-pressure mercury lamp (1 mW, 300 J cm-2) resulted in oxidative stress correlated with increased autofluorescence intensity, onset of nuclear fluorescence, and a fluorescence lifetime decrease. The cellular response to femtosecond NIR microbeams depended significantly on peak power. Peak powers above a threshold value of about 0.5 kW (average power: 6 mW). 0.55 kW (7 mW) and 0.8 kW (10 mW) at 730 nm, 760 nm and 800 nm, respectively, resulted in the onset of short-lived luminescence with higher intensity (100 x) than the intracellular NAD(P)H fluorescence. This luminescence, accompanied by destruction of cellular morphology, was localized and occurred in the mitochondrial region. In contrast, beams at a power of less than 0.5 kW allowed nondestructive fluorophore detection with high spatial and temporal resolution without modification of cellular redox state or cell morphology.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) of cancers is associated with the destruction of the microvasculature supplying the tumor. The study elucidates the role of red blood cells in PDT-induced vascular injury.
STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: Intracellular accumulation of several photosensitizers in human (non-nucleated) and chicken (nucleated) erythrocytes, as well as photodynamic induced hemolysis were studied using 488 nm laser microirradiation (15 microW) and confocal laser scanning fluorescence microscopy.
RESULTS: Cells incubated with anionic hydrophilic compounds TPPS4 and Pd-TPPS4 exhibited no fluorescence before irradiation, but developed strong and sustained fluorescence in the cellular and nuclear membranes following photoinduced membrane damage. In contrast, microirradiation of Photofrin-incubated erythrocytes showed instantaneous fluorescence which decreased due to photodegradation. For the cationic hydrophilic dye methylene blue, significant fluorescence was detected only in the nucleus. Following ALA incubation, large intercellular differences were observed in fluorescence in the red spectral region. Photofrin induced the most efficient hemolysis. Higher radiant exposures were required for lysis of nucleated rather than of non-nucleated red blood cells, except in the case of methylene blue.
CONCLUSION: Laser microbeams were used, for the first time, to study photodynamic cell damage. Erythrocytes were shown to be primary targets in PDT. Damage to red blood cells could be responsible for hemostasis in the vascular bed of a tumor, which was reported by many groups.},

METHODS: Studies on corneal surgery and flap processing on enucleated porcine eyes were performed using a newly developed ytterbium-doped gain media laser source. Ultraviolet femtosecond laser pulses centered at a wavelength of 345 nm and working at a repetition rate of 100 kHz were generated by the third harmonics of the 1035-nm fundamental wavelength.
RESULTS: Flaps with a diameter of 6 mm and a thickness of 100 microm were created in less than 2 minutes with low energy pulses. Transmissions and spectral measurements were performed during flap processing. Less than 2\% UV radiation reaches the retina during corneal flap processing. A detectable transmittance towards the retina of visible light centered on 440 nm was found for UV pulses.
CONCLUSIONS: Ultraviolet corneal refractive surgery is a novel procedure and has the potential to be an alternative to infrared refractive surgery considering safety aspects.},

RESULTS: Multiphoton microscopy/tomography proved capable of determining the target of interest, and of visualizing and optically evaluating the in vivo intrastromal laser surgical outcomes with high efficiency. More interesting, using this technique, activated intrastromal keratocytes (myofibroblasts) were detected in vivo 24 hours after intrastromal surgery.
CONCLUSION: Multiphoton microscopy/tomography is an efficient and convenient non-invasive imaging method which can be used not only to assess intrastromal microsurgical performance but also to perform in vivo follow-up observations on wound repair.},

	abstract = {The most important application of continuous wave (cw) near infrared (NIR) microbeams in cellular and molecular biology are single-beam gradient force optical traps, also called "laser tweezers". Laser tweezers have been used for optical picoNewton force determination as well as for 3D cellular and intracellular micromanipulation, such as optical spermatozoa transportation in laser-assisted in vitro fertilization. Light intensities in the MW/cm2 range are necessary to confine motile spermatozoa in the optical trap. The enormous photon concentration in space and time results in non-resonant two-photon excitation of endogenous and exogenous absorbers with electronic transitions in the ultraviolet and visible spectral range. Trap-induced two-photon excitation of intracellular flurorophores can be used to study metabolism and vitality of motile cells without additional fluorescence excitation sources. Therefore, laser tweezers as sources of two-photon excitation may act as novel non-linear tools in cell diagnostics. The far red/NIR trapping radiation, in particular {\textless}800 nm, may also excite endogenous absorbers such as NAD(P)H, flavins, porphyrins and cytochromes. Excitation of these cellular absorbers may result in oxidative stress via type I and type II photooxidation processes. Severe non-linear-induced cell damage in a variety of cells confined in {\textless}800 nm traps was found. Two-photon induced destructive effects are enhanced in multimode traps due to longitudinal mode-beating phenomena. Pulsed laser sources are not suitable for safe optical trapping of living cells. The use of single frequency long-wavelength NIR traps (800 nm-1200 nm) for vital cell handling is recommended.},

We used a MPTflex™ Multiphoton Laser Tomograph (JenLab, Germany). We examined cultured glioma cells in an orthotopic mouse tumor model and native human tissue samples. Finally the multiphoton tomograph was applied to provide optical biopsies during resection of a clinical case of glioblastoma. All tissues imaged by multiphoton tomography were sampled and processed for conventional histopathology. The multiphoton tomograph allowed fluorescence intensity- and fluorescence lifetime imaging with submicron spatial resolution and 200 picosecond temporal resolution. Morphological fluorescence intensity imaging and fluorescence lifetime imaging of tumor-bearing mouse brains and native human tissue samples clearly differentiated tumor and adjacent brain tissue. Intraoperative imaging was found to be technically feasible. Intraoperative image quality was comparable to ex vivo examinations. To our knowledge we here present the first intraoperative application of high resolution multiphoton tomography and fluorescence lifetime imaging of human brain tumors in situ. It allowed in vivo identification and determination of cell density of tumor tissue on a cellular and subcellular level within seconds.

A major application is the in vivo determination of the skin age index.

The autofluorescence emission spectrum of sperm of the common bedbug, Cimex lectularius, was consistent with the presence of flavins and NAD(P)H. The mean fluorescence lifetimes showed smaller variation in sperm extracted from the male (tau m, τm = 1.54-1.84 ns) than in that extracted from the female sperm storage organ (tau m, τm = 1.26-2.00 ns). The fluorescence lifetime histograms revealed four peaks. These peaks (0.18, 0.92, 2.50 and 3.80 ns) suggest the presence of NAD(P)H and flavins and show that sperm metabolism can be characterized using fluorescence lifetime imaging. The difference in fluorescence lifetime variation between the sexes is consistent with the notion that female animals alter the metabolism of sperm cells during storage. It is not consistent, however, with the idea that sperm metabolism represents a sexually selected character that provides females with information about the male genotype.},

The mean lifetime, and particularly its second component, can be useful to distinguish resilin-rich from resilin-poor parts of the cuticle. The few existing literature data suggest that chitin is unlikely responsible for the main autofluorescent component observed in the resilin-poor areas in our study and that melanin requires further scrutiny.

Laser-assisted surgery based on multiphoton absorption of near-infrared laser light has great potential for high precision surgery at various depths within the cells and tissues. Clinical applications include refractive surgery (fs-LASIK). The non-contact laser method also supports contamination-free cell nanosurgery. In this paper we describe usage of an ultrashort femtosecond laser scanning microscope for sub-100 nm surgery of human cells and metaphase chromosomes. A mode-locked 85 MHz Ti:Sapphire laser with an M-shaped ultrabroad band spectrum (maxima: 770  nm/830  nm) and an in situ pulse duration at the target ranging from 12 fs up to 3 ps was employed. The effects of laser nanoprocessing in cells and chromosomes have been quantified by atomic force microscopy. These studies demonstrate the potential of extreme ultrashort femtosecond laser pulses at low mean milliwatt powers for sub-100 nm surgery of cells and cellular organelles.},

	abstract = {Our laboratory has previously developed a bacterial cancer therapy strategy by targeting tumors using engineered Salmonella typhimurium auxotrophs (S. typhimurium A1-R) that were generated to grow in viable as well as necrotic areas of tumors but not in normal tissue. The mechanism by which A1-R kills cancer cells is unknown. In the present report, high-resolution multiphoton tomography was used to investigate the cellular basis of bacteria killing of cancer cells in live mice. Lewis lung cancer cells (LLC) were genetically labeled with red fluorescent protein (RFP) and injected subcutaneously in nude mice. After tumor growth was observed, the mice were treated with A1-R bacteria expressing GFP, via tail-vein injection. Mice without A1-R treatment served as untreated controls. The imaging system was 3D scan head mounted on a flexible mechano-optical articulated arm. A tunable 80 MHz titanium:sapphire femtosecond laser (710-920 nm) was used for the multiphoton tomography. We applied this high-resolution imaging tool to visualize A1-R bacteria targeting the Lewis lung cancer cells growing subcutaneously in nude mice. The tomographic images revealed that bacterially-infected cancer cells greatly expanded and burst and thereby lost viability. Similar results were seen in vitro using confocal microscopy. The bacteria targeted the tumor within minutes of tail-vein injection. Using mice in which the nestin-promoter drives GFP and in which blood vessels are labeled with GFP, the bacteria could be imaged in and out of the blood vessels. Collagen scaffolds within the tumor were imaged by second harmonic generation (SHG). The multiphoton tomographic system described here allows imaging of cancer cell killing by bacteria and can therefore be used to further understand its mechanism and optimization for clinical application.},

Experimental human G-3 colonic tumours were transplanted into nude mice, and ten mice were treated by PDT. Ten animals served as controls. We measured a fluorescence intensity of the tumour that was about eight times higher than in the surrounding tissue; a good correlation between the fluorescence intensity and the photodynamic effect was found.

We present a solution to this problem by measuring the IRF using the ultrafast luminescence from gold nanorods. We show that ultrafast gold nanorod luminescence allows the IRF to be directly obtained in multiple spectral channels simultaneously across a wide spectral range.

	abstract = {The binding of superquencher molecular beacon (SQMB) probes to human single-stranded cellular miRNA-122 targets was detected in various single live cells with femtosecond laser microscopy. For delivery of the SQMB-probes, 3D-nanoprocessing of single cells with sub-15 femtosecond 85 MHz near-infrared laser pulses was applied. Transient nanopores were formed by focusing the laser beam for some milliseconds on the membrane of a single cell in order to import of SQMB-probes into the cells. In single cells of the human liver cell lines Huh-7D12 and IHH that expressed miRNA-122, we measured target binding in the cytoplasm by two-photon fluorescence imaging. We found increased fluorescence with time in a nonlinear manner up to the point where steady state saturation was reached. We also studied the intracellular distribution of target SQMB and provide for the first time strong experimental evidence that cytoplasmic miRNA travels into the cell nucleus. To interpret nonlinear binding, a number of individual miRNA-122 positive cells (Huh-7D12 and IHH) and negative control cells, human VA13 fibroblasts and Caco-2 cells were analyzed. Our experimental data are consistent with the cytoplasmic assembly of nuclear miRNA and provide further mechanistic insight in the regulatory function of miRNAs in cellular physiology. An open issue in the regulation of gene expression by miRNA is whether miRNA can activate gene expression in addition to the well-known inhibitory effect. A first step for such a regulatory role could be the travelling of miRNA-RISC into the nucleus.},

RESULTS: The morphological appearance of keratinocytes showed polygonal cells in the horny layer, a granular cytoplasm in the stratum granulosum, smaller prickle cells in the stratum spinosum and hyperpigmented small round basal cells. Actinic keratoses presented remarkable differences including widened inter-cellular spaces, heterogeneity in cellular fluorescence and shape as well as an increased ratio of nuclear to cellular size. Finally, the thickness of the epidermis was significantly increased in actinic keratoses compared with the control.

MPT is readily combined with time resolved detectors to achieve fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM). The aim of our study was to identify morphologic MPT/FLIM descriptors of melanocytic nevi, referring to cellular and architectural features.
METHODS: In the preliminary study, MPT/FLIM images referring to 16 ex vivo nevi were simultaneously evaluated by 3 observers for the identification of morphologic descriptors characteristic of melanocytic nevi. Proposed descriptors were discussed and the parameters referring to epidermal keratinocytes, epidermal melanocytes, dermo-epidermal junction, papillary dermis and overall architecture were selected. In the main study, the presence/absence of the specified criteria were blindly evaluated on a test set, comprising 102 ex vivo samples (51 melanocytic nevi, 51 miscellaneous skin lesions) by 2 observers.
RESULTS: Twelve descriptors were identified: "short-lifetime cells in the stratum corneum", "melanin-containing keratinocytes", "dendritic cells", "small short-lifetime cells" in the upper and lower layers", "edged papillae", "non-edged papillae", "junctional nests of short-lifetime cells", "dermal cell clusters", "short-lifetime cells in the papilla", "monomorphic and regular histoarchitecture", "architectural disarray".
CONCLUSION: Identified descriptors for benign melanocytic lesions proved sensitive and specific, enabling the differentiation between melanocytic nevi and non-melanocytic lesions.},

	abstract = {Multiphoton laser tomography (MPT) combined with fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) is a non-invasive imaging technique, based on the study of fluorescence decay times of naturally occurring fluorescent molecules, enabling a non-invasive investigation of the skin with subcellular resolution. The aim of this retrospective observational ex vivo study, was to characterize melanoma both from a morphologic and a quantitative point of view, attaining an improvement in the diagnostic accuracy with respect to dermoscopy. In the training phase, thirty parameters, comprising both cytological descriptors and architectural aspects, were identified. The training set included 6 melanomas with a mean Breslow thickness±S.D. of 0.89±0.48 mm. In the test phase, these parameters were blindly evaluated on a test data set consisting of 25 melanomas, 50 nevi and 50 basal cell carcinomas. Melanomas in the test phase comprised 8 in situ lesions and had a mean thickness±S.D. of 0.77±1.2 mm. Moreover, quantitative FLIM data were calculated for special areas of interest. Melanoma was characterized by the presence of atypical short lifetime cells and architectural disorder, in contrast to nevi presenting typical cells and a regular histoarchitecture. Sensitivity and specificity values for melanoma diagnosis were 100\% and 98\%, respectively, whereas dermoscopy achieved the same sensitivity, but a lower specificity (82\%). Mean fluorescence lifetime values of melanocytic cells did not vary between melanomas and nevi, but significantly differed from those referring to basal cell carcinoma enabling a differential diagnosis based on quantitative data. Data from prospective preoperative trials are needed to confirm if MPT/FLIM could increase diagnostic specificity and thus reduce unnecessary surgical excisions.},

Dermoscopy provides two-dimensional color images of the skin surface with a magnification up to 70 x. Depending on the ultrasonic frequencies from 7.5 MHz to 100 MHz, the signal depth varies from about 1 mm to 80 mm. Vertical ultrasound wide-field images provide fast information on depth and volume of the lesion. The 100 MHz ultrasound allows imaging with resolutions down to 16 μm (axial) and 32 μm (lateral). Multiphoton tomography provides 0.36 x 0.36 x 0.001 mm³ horizontal optical sections of a particular region of interest with submicron resolution down to 200 μm tissue depth. The autofluorescence of mitochondrial coenzymes, keratin, melanin, and elastin as well as the network of collagen structures can be imaged. The combination of ultrasound and MPT opens novel synergistic possibilities in diagnostics of skin diseases with a special focus on the early detection of skin cancer as well as the evaluation of treatments.},

In vivo multiphoton laser tomography represents a recently developed diagnostic tool that allows non-invasive tissue imaging. We aim to demonstrate the application of multiphoton laser tomography for the in vivo differentiation and diagnosis of melanoma. Laser radiation in the near infrared spectrum was used to image endogenous fluorophores by multiphoton excitation. Eighty-three melanocytic skin lesions have been investigated. The results showed distinct morphological differences in melanoma compared with melanocytic nevi. In particular, six characteristic features of malignant melanoma were specified and statistically evaluated. Sensitivity values up to 95\% (range: 71-95\%) and specificity values up to 97\% (range: 69-97\%) were achieved for diagnostic classification. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the most significant diagnostic criteria. We found that architectural disarray of the epidermis, poorly defined keratinocyte cell borders as well as the presence of pleomorphic or dendritic cells were of prime importance. By means of this procedure accuracy values up to 97\% were reached. These findings underline the potential applicability of multiphoton laser tomography in melanoma diagnosis of melanocytic skin lesions.},

After study approval by the local Ethics Committee, 47 patients (31 male, 16 female, age range: 24-88 years) were recruited from the Department of Dermatology of the University Hospital Jena. In this work, we present an illustrative selection of eleven cases from a clinical study combining in vivo MPT with in vivo CLSM. The patients presented with a broad range of dermatological disorders including seborrheic keratoses, angioma, actinic keratoses, melanocytic nevi, malignant melanoma, psoriasis, pemphigus vulgaris and scarring. Both methods, CLSM and MPT, were found to be suitable for in vivo imaging of superficial skin layers and may therefore be useful in dermatological practice for the diagnosis of skin diseases. However, both methods differ in their technical and physical principles. Thus, despite of many similarities concerning the morphological presentation of cells and tissues, important differences are recognized. Synergies of the combination of CLSM and MPT may be obtained by combined implementation in order to benefit from the fast overview given by CLSM and the detailed imaging of skin structures by MPT.},

Overall 46 melanocytic lesions of human skin were analysed. We suggested that fluorescence light, detected in such a way, may yield additional information for melanoma diagnostics. Remarkable differences in lifetime behaviour of keratinocytes in contrast to melanocytes were observed. Fluorescence lifetime distribution was found in correlation with the intracellular amount of melanin. Spectral analysis of melanoma revealed a main fluorescence peak around 470 nm in combination with an additional peak close to 550 nm throughout all epidermal layers. Excitation at 800 nm shows a selectively observable fluorescence of melanin containing cells and offers the possibility of cell classification. Procedures of selective imaging as well as spectral fluorescence lifetime imaging by means of multiphoton laser tomography support diagnostic decisions and may improve the process of non-invasive early detection of melanoma.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Morphological changes in the dermal collagen and elastin fibre network are characteristic for skin ageing and for pathological skin conditions of the dermis.
OBJECTIVES: To characterize pathological and physiological conditions by multiphoton laser scanning tomography (MLT) in vivo, it is necessary to investigate and identify morphological alterations related to ageing.
METHODS: In vivo MLT was used to image two-photon excited autofluorescence (AF) and second harmonics generation (SHG) in human dermis of 18 volunteers of different ages. Criteria for the evaluation of age-dependent morphological changes in MLT images were fibre tension and morphology, network pattern, clot formation and image homogeneity. These criteria were weighted and a score was calculated.
RESULTS: The resulting MLT-based Dermis Morphology Score is correlated with age (R2 = -0.90) and with the previously published SHG to AF Ageing Index of Dermis (R2 = 0.66). The two groups of young (age 21-38) and old (age 66-84) volunteers showed a significant difference in MLT score values (P {\textless} 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: We could demonstrate an in vivo relationship between morphological characteristics of human dermis assessed by MLT and age. The present score allows the semi-quantitative evaluation of specific morphological changes of the dermal fibre network in ageing skin by in vivo AF and SHG imaging. This method will be useful for diagnostics of pathological conditions and their differentiation from ageing effects.},

In this study, the applicability of multiphoton tomography (MPT) as an in vivo diagnostic tool for AK and SCC was evaluated. Changes in the morphology of the keratinocytes such as broadened epidermis, large intercellular spaces, enlarged nucleus and a large variance in cell shape could easily be recognized. The cell nuclei of AK and SCC were significantly larger compared to healthy skin cells in all cell layers. The nucleus-cytoplasm ratio was also significantly higher for AK and SCC than for the healthy skin cells. It was even higher in SCC compared to spinous and basal cell layer of AK. The cell density in AK and SCC was significantly lower than in the basal and spinous cell layers of healthy skin. In SCC, the cell density was significantly lower than in AK. Concerning the intercellular spaces, significant differences were found for AK and healthy skin in spinous and basal cell layer and for SCC compared to AK and healthy skin. In this study, MPT proved to be a valuable non-invasive imaging method for in vivo detection and discrimination of AK and SCC from healthy skin.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Skin aging is accelerated by extrinsic factors, particularly actinic damage. Over the last decades, both clinical and pathological differences between intrinsic and actinic aging have been characterized. In this work, we aimed at quantifying skin aging by non-invasive in vivo methods.
METHODS: Young healthy volunteers using indoor tanning facilities and aged people were compared with appropriate controls by measurements of skin elasticity with the Cutometer and the Reviscometer and by semi-quantitative evaluation of the dermal matrix composition by the multiphoton laser tomograph DermaInspect.
RESULTS: We found differences between the sun-protected volar forearm and the dorsal side as well as between young and old test persons with all three methods. No significant differences were found between the skin of indoor-tanned test persons and control. Also, gender had no influence on the severity of skin aging.
CONCLUSION: The most consistent results were obtained with the DermaInspect. The considerable inter-individual variation due to the cross-sectional design of the study may have disguised the factual skin damage caused by tanning beds.},

The aim of our study was to assess the sensitivity and specificity of MPT/FLIM descriptors for basal cell carcinoma (BCC), to improve BCC diagnosis and the identification of tumor margins. In the preliminary study, FLIM images referring to 35 BCCs and 35 healthy skin samples were evaluated for the identification of morphologic descriptors characteristic of BCC. In the main study, the selected parameters were blindly evaluated on a test set comprising 63 BCCs, 63 healthy skin samples and 66 skin lesions. Moreover, FLIM values inside a region of interest were calculated on 98 healthy skin and 98 BCC samples. In the preliminary study, three epidermal descriptors and 7 BCC descriptors were identified. The specificity of the diagnostic criteria versus 'other lesions' was extremely high, indicating that the presence of at least one BCC descriptor makes the diagnosis of 'other lesion' extremely unlikely. FLIM values referring to BCC cells significantly differed from those of healthy skin. In this study, we identified morphological and numerical descriptors enabling the differentiation of BCC from other skin disorders and its distinction from healthy skin in ex vivo samples. In future, MPT/FLIM may be applied to skin lesions to provide direct clinical guidance before biopsy and histological examination and for the identification of tumor margins allowing a complete surgical removal.},

The histogramming process avoids any time gating or wavelength scanning and, therefore, yields a near-perfect counting efficiency. The time resolution is limited only by the transit time spread of the detector. The technique can be used with almost any confocal or two-photon laser scanning microscope and works at any scanning rate.

Images were acquired from 19 freshly excised BCCs and 27 samples of normal skin (in \& ex vivo). Features from fluorescence lifetime images were used to discriminate BCCs with a sensitivity/specificity of 79\%/93\% respectively. A mosaic of BCC fluorescence lifetime images covering {\textgreater}1 mm(2) is also presented, demonstrating the potential for tumour margin delineation. Using 10,462 manually segmented cells from the image data, we quantify the cellular morphology and spectroscopic differences between BCCs and normal skin for the first time. Statistically significant increases were found in the fluorescence lifetimes of cells from BCCs in all spectral channels, ranging from 19.9\% (425-515 nm spectral emission) to 39.8\% (620-655 nm emission). A discriminant analysis based diagnostic algorithm allowed the fraction of cells classified as malignant to be calculated for each patient. This yielded a receiver operator characteristic area under the curve for the detection of BCC of 0.83. We have used both morphological and spectroscopic parameters to discriminate BCC from normal skin, and provide a comprehensive base for how this technique could be used for BCC assessment in clinical practice.},

Without staining, a second harmonic generation signal was detected for collagen when excited at wavelength lambda(ex) = 840 nm. Switching the excitation wavelength to 760 nm enabled visualization of elastic fiber structures. A limitation of this technology is the laser-tuning process that requires calibration of the system in between the studies. Now we have developed a facilitated method for studying tissues and tissue equivalents that enables simultaneous visualization of collagen and elastin structures using only a single excitation wavelength of 840 nm in combination with two different band-pass filters. This facilitated method will expand the range of application by reducing required time and expenses for the laser system without reducing its capability.},

Nestin-expressing stem cells of both the BA and DP have been previously shown to be able to form neurons and other non-follicle cell types. The nestin-expressing stem cells from the DP have been termed skin precursor or SKP cells. Both nestin-expressing DP and BA cells have been previously shown to effect repair of the injured spinal cord and peripheral nerve, with the BA being the greater and more constant source of the stem cells. The BA contains nestin-expressing stem cells throughout the hair cycle, whereas nestin-expressing dermal papillae stem cells were found in early and mid-anagen only. Our previous studies have shown that the nestin-expressing stem cells in the BA and DP have similar morphological features. The cells from both regions have a small body diameter of approximately 7 µm with long extrusions, as shown by 2-photon imaging. In the present study, using 2-photon imaging of whisker follicles from transgenic mice expressing nestin-driven green fluorescent protein (ND-GFP), we demonstrate that the BA is the source of the nestin-expressing stem cells of the hair follicle. The nestin-expressing stem cells migrate from the BA to the DP as well as into the surrounding skin tissues including the epidermis, and during wound healing, suggesting that the BA may be the source of the stem cells of the skin itself.},

	abstract = {Multiphoton excitation laser scanning microscopy, relying on the simultaneous absorption of two or more photons by a molecule, is one of the most exciting recent developments in biomedical imaging. Thanks to its superior imaging capability of deeper tissue penetration and efficient light detection, this system becomes more and more an inspiring tool for intravital bulk tissue imaging. Two-photon excitation microscopy including 2-photon fluorescence and second harmonic generated signal microscopy is the most common multiphoton microscopic application. In the present review we take diverse ocular tissues as intravital samples to demonstrate the advantages of this approach. Experiments with registration of intracellular 2-photon fluorescence and extracellular collagen second harmonic generated signal microscopy in native ocular tissues are focused. Data show that the in-tandem combination of 2-photon fluorescence and second harmonic generated signal microscopy as two-modality microscopy allows for in situ co-localization imaging of various microstructural components in the whole-mount deep intravital tissues. New applications and recent developments of this high technology in clinical studies such as 2-photon-controlled drug release, in vivo drug screening and administration in skin and kidney, as well as its uses in tumourous tissues such as melanoma and glioma, in diseased lung, brain and heart are additionally reviewed. Intrinsic emission two-modal 2-photon microscopy/tomography, acting as an efficient and sensitive non-injurious imaging approach featured by high contrast and subcellular spatial resolution, has been proved to be a promising tool for intravital deep tissue imaging and clinical studies. Given the level of its performance, we believe that the non-linear optical imaging technique has tremendous potentials to find more applications in biomedical fundamental and clinical research in the near future.},

	abstract = {With the increase in the number of antibiotic resistant strains of microorganism, the search for alternative treatments of microbial infections becomes all the more important. We report a novel method for bacterial inactivation based on the optical excitation of the naturally occurring (endogenous) photosensitzing porphyrins by red light. In particular, the pathogenic Gram-positive porphyrin producing ATCC strains Propionibacterium acnes, Actinomyces odontolyticus and Porphyromonas gingivalis were investigated. Sensitive autofluorescence spectroscopy revealed that these bacteria naturally synthezise the fluorescent photosensitizer protoporphyrin IX. In addition, bacterial plaque samples of periodontitis patients were studied. Non-labeled fluorescent bacterial colonies were exposed to red light at 632.8 nm, 100 mW/cm2 light intensity and 360 J/cm2 energy density using a helium-neon laser. The survival rate after a single phototreatment with red light was found to be 0.58 +/- 0.09 in the case of Propionibacterium acnes, 0.30 +/- 0.04 in Actinomyces odontolyticus and 0.59 +/- 0.10 in Porphyrormonas gingivalis compared to non-exposed bacteria suspensions. No photoeffect was found for the bacterium Streptococcus mutans which exhibited no detectable porphyrin autofluorescence. Red-light exposed plaque samples of patients showed significant reduction of colony forming units by 50\% as well as a pronounced photoeffect on the pigmented species Prevotella intermedia. Taken together, these results suggest the treatment with red light can be potentially employed as an therapeutic method to inactivate certain pathogenic strains of porphyrin producing bacteria without the use of external photosensitizers.},

	abstract = {Near infrared (NIR) multiphoton microscopy is becoming a novel optical tool of choice for fluorescence imaging with high spatial and temporal resolution, diagnostics, photochemistry and nanoprocessing within living cells and tissues. Three-dimensional fluorescence imaging based on non-resonant two-photon or three-photon fluorophor excitation requires light intensities in the range of MW cm(-2) to GW cm(-2), which can be derived by diffraction limited focusing of continuous wave and pulsed NIR laser radiation. NIR lasers can be employed as the excitation source for multifluorophor multiphoton excitation and hence multicolour imaging. In combination with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), this novel approach can be used for multi-gene detection (multiphoton multicolour FISH). Owing to the high NIR penetration depth, non-invasive optical biopsies can be obtained from patients and ex vivo tissue by morphological and functional fluorescence imaging of endogenous fluorophores such as NAD(P)H, flavin, lipofuscin, porphyrins, collagen and elastin. Recent botanical applications of multiphoton microscopy include depth-resolved imaging of pigments (chlorophyll) and green fluorescent proteins as well as non-invasive fluorophore loading into single living plant cells. Non-destructive fluorescence imaging with multiphoton microscopes is limited to an optical window. Above certain intensities, multiphoton laser microscopy leads to impaired cellular reproduction, formation of giant cells, oxidative stress and apoptosis-like cell death. Major intracellular targets of photodamage in animal cells are mitochondria as well as the Golgi apparatus. The damage is most likely based on a two-photon excitation process rather than a one-photon or three-photon event. Picosecond and femtosecond laser microscopes therefore provide approximately the same safe relative optical window for two-photon vital cell studies. In labelled cells, additional phototoxic effects may occur via photodynamic action. This has been demonstrated for aminolevulinic acid-induced protoporphyrin IX and other porphyrin sensitizers in cells. When the light intensity in NIR microscopes is increased to TW cm(-2) levels, highly localized optical breakdown and plasma formation do occur. These femtosecond NIR laser microscopes can also be used as novel ultraprecise nanosurgical tools with cut sizes between 100 nm and 300 nm. Using the versatile nanoscalpel, intracellular dissection of chromosomes within living cells can be performed without perturbing the outer cell membrane. Moreover, cells remain alive. Non-invasive NIR laser surgery within a living cell or within an organelle is therefore possible.},

	abstract = {We have used near-infrared femtosecond Titanium: Sapphire laser pulses as novel non-invasive means for dye loading into various cell types of the Arabidopsis root meristem, and by 3D imaging have assessed the extent of dye coupling between the meristematic cells. The post-embryonic primary root of Arabidopsis thaliana has an invariant ontogeny and fixed cellular organisation which makes it an attractive model system to study developmental events involving cell fate determination, cellular differentiation and pattern formation. Local intercellular communication and local transmission of positional signals are likely to play a pivotal role in cell proliferation and regulation of differentiation. We have therefore examined the extent to which the constituent cells in the root meristem are symplastically coupled. Following laser-assisted loading of membrane impermeate fluorescent dye propidium iodide (PI) in single cells, we show by time-lapse and 3D imaging that in the root tip all undifferentiated cells are dye-coupled. When PI is permeated into the central cells, it rapidly moved into the adjacent initials of the columella, cortex, pericycle and stele. Interestingly, when only either of the initials were loaded with the dye, it never moved into any of the central cells. Amongst the epidermal cells, the differentiated hair cells are symplastically isolated. Our data provide evidence (1) for differential dye-coupling behaviour between quiescent centre cells and the neighbouring initials; (2) that cells in the root are coupled during stages at which the cell-lineage pattern is formed and that it becomes progressively secluded as they differentiate and the pattern is fixed. Taken together, our NIR-laser mediated approach is highly efficient and has numerous potential applications for non-invasive permeation of dyes in different cell types.},

	abstract = {AIMS: The aim of this study was to compare morphological aspects of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) as assessed by two different imaging methods: in vivo reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) and multiphoton tomography with fluorescence lifetime imaging implementation (MPT-FLIM).
METHODS: The study comprised 16 BCCs for which a complete set of RCM and MPT-FLIM images were available. The presence of seven MPT-FLIM descriptors was evaluated. The presence of seven RCM equivalent parameters was scored in accordance to their extension. Chi-squared test with Fisher's exact test and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient were determined between MPT-FLIM scores and adjusted-RCM scores.
RESULTS: MPT-FLIM and RCM descriptors of BCC were coupled to match the descriptors that define the same pathological structures. The comparison included: Streaming and Aligned elongated cells, Streaming with multiple directions and Double alignment, Palisading (RCM) and Palisading (MPT-FLIM), Typical tumor islands, and Cell islands surrounded by fibers, Dark silhouettes and Phantom islands, Plump bright cells and Melanophages, Vessels (RCM), and Vessels (MPT-FLIM). The parameters that were significantly correlated were Melanophages/Plump Bright Cells, Aligned elongated cells/Streaming, Double alignment/Streaming with multiple directions, and Palisading (MPT-FLIM)/Palisading (RCM).
CONCLUSION: According to our data, both methods are suitable to image BCC's features. The concordance between MPT-FLIM and RCM is high, with some limitations due to the technical differences between the two devices. The hardest difficulty when comparing the images generated by the two imaging modalities is represented by their different field of view.},

In contrast to that, skin images measured with all three different excitation sources with mean powers of each laser adjusted to the particular pulse length and repetition rate exhibited discrepancies from this relation.

For this purpose, fluorescence lifetime measurements (FLIM) were performed with 47 volunteers of different age groups at sun-protected and sun-exposed localizations. Bi-exponential curve fitting was applied to the FLIM data, and characteristic differences between age groups and localizations were found in both relevant fit parameters describing the decay slope.

The software evaluates the image contrast of cell contours, automatically designates cell locations for laser illumination, centres those locations in the laser focus, and executes the illumination. By software-controlled meandering of the sample stage, in principle all cells in a typical cell culture dish can be targeted without further user interaction. The automation allows for a significant increase in the number of treatable cells compared to a manual approach. For a laser illumination duration of 100 ms, 7-8 positions on different cells can be targeted every second inside the area of the microscope field of view. The experimental capabilities of the setup are illustrated in experiments with Chinese hamster ovary cells.

	abstract = {New multiphoton and confocal microscope technologies and fluorescence lifetime imaging techniques are now being used to non-invasively image, in space (three dimensions),in time, in spectra, in lifetime and in fluorescence anisotropy (total of 7 dimensions), fluorescent molecules in in situ and in vivo biological tissue, including skin. The process involves scanning a 2D area and measuring fluorescence at a given tissue depth below the surface after excitation by a laser beam with a wavelength within the one-photon or two-photon absorption band of the fluorophores followed by the stacking together of a series of 2D images from different depths to reconstruct the full spatial structure of the sample. Our aim in this work is to describe the principles, opportunities, limitations and applications of this new technology and its application in defining skin morphology, disease and skin penetration in vitro and in vivo by drugs, chemicals and nanoparticles. A key emphasis is in the use of fluorescence lifetime imaging to add additional specificity and quantitation to the detection of the various exogenous chemicals and nanoparticles that may be applied to the skin as well as endogenous fluorescent species in the skin. Examples given include equipment configuration; components in skin autofluorescence in various skin strata; imaging and quantification of coexisting drugs and their metabolites; skin pH; nanoparticle zinc oxide skin penetration; liposome delivery of drugs to deeper tissues; and observations in skin ageing and in various skin diseases.},

	issn = {0960-7412},
	abstract = {In this report, we describe a highly reproducible femtosecond near-infrared (NIR) laser-based nanoprocessing technique that can be used both for non-invasive intra-tissue nanodissection of plant cell walls as well as selective destruction of a single plastid or part thereof without compromising the viability of the cells. The ultra-precise intra-tissue nanoprocessing is achieved by the generation of high light intensity (10(12)W cm(-2)) by diffraction-limited focusing of the radiation of an NIR (lambda = 740 and 800 nm) femtosecond titanium-sapphire laser to a sub-femtolitre volume and subsequent highly localized instantaneous plasma formation. Following nanosurgery, electron microscopical analysis of the corresponding cellular target areas revealed clean non-staggering lesions across the cell wall with a cut width measuring less than 400 nm. To our knowledge, this is the smallest cut made non-invasively within a plant tissue. Further evidence, including two-photon imaging of chlorophyll fluorescence, revealed that a single target chloroplast or part thereof can be completely knocked out using intense ultra-fast NIR pulses without any visible deleterious effect on the adjacent plastids. The vitality of the cells after nanoprocessing has been ascertained by exclusion of propidium iodide from the cells as well as by the presence of cytoplasmic streaming. The potential applications of this technical advance include developmental biology applications, particularly studies addressing spatio-temporal control of ontogenetic events and cell-cell interactions, and gravitational biology applications.},

	volume = {214},
	issn = {0032-0935},
	abstract = {Non-linear excitation of fluorophores by contemporaneous absorption of two or more near-infrared (NIR) photons following diffraction-limited focusing with high-numerical-aperture objectives circumvents out-of-focus fluorescence (without a confocal pinhole) and spatially limits photobleaching and photodamage to the minute sub-femtoliter focal volume. This is in contrast to optical events in conventional confocal imaging systems using ultraviolet (UV) or visible laser sources wherein the entire sectors of the specimen above and below the plane of focus experience massive photostress and photodamage. In addition, NIR wavelengths penetrate deeper into the highly scattering environs of plant tissue than UV and visible wavelengths. We delineate a novel non-invasive technique using NIR femtosecond laser pulses at lambda = 740, 760, 780, and 800 nm for induction of chlorophyll fluorescence by the two-photon effect as well as for intra-tissue time-lapse vital three-dimensional imaging of fundamental events of chloroplast division in deeply seated bundle sheath cells of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. leaves. Our findings establish that (i) mature bundle sheath chloroplasts are indeed capable of division, (ii) the dividing chloroplasts assume a distinct constricted/dumbbell-shaped profile with an average lifespan of 20-25 min, (iii) the complete division of the pre-existing chloroplasts occurs within 50 min, and (iv) the two derivative daughter chloroplasts are invariably unequal in size. This novel NIR-laser-based technique has any number of potential applications, including (i) non-invasive intra-vital imaging of molecular and ion dynamics, (ii) non-destructive screening of mutants impaired in photosynthesis, (iii) diagnosis of physiological states of plants and (iv) bio-optical taxonomy.},

Both systems are applied to nine patients prior to surgery, and the results are analyzed, including histological results. Both systems prove suitable for detecting typical characteristics of BCC in various stages. The RLSM allows large horizontal overview images to be obtained, enabling the investigator to find the regions of interest quickly, e.g., BCC nests. Elongated cells and palisading structures are easily recognized using both methods. Due to the higher resolution, changes in nucleus diameter or cytoplasm could be visualized with the MPT. Therefore, the nucleus diameter, nucleus/cytoplasm ratio, and cell density are estimated for normal and BCC cells using the MPT. The nucleus of elongated BCC cells is significantly longer than other measured normal skin cells, whereas the cell density and nucleus/cytoplasm ratio of BCC cannot be significantly distinguished from granular cells.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Multiphoton Laser Tomography (MPT) is a non-linear optical technique that gives access to morphology and structure of both cells and extracellular matrix of the skin through the combination of autofluorescence imaging and second harmonic generation (SHG). The aim of this study was to identify MPT descriptors on ex vivo specimens of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) to assess the sensitivity and specificity of these criteria for the diagnosis of BCC and its differentiation from other skin tumours, inflammatory diseases and healthy skin.
METHODS: In the preliminary study, MPT images referring to 24 BCCs and 24 healthy skin samples were simultaneously evaluated by three observers for the identification of features characteristic of BCC. In the main study, the presence/absence of the descriptors identified in the preliminary study was blindly evaluated on a test set, comprising 66 BCCs, 66 healthy skin samples and 66 skin lesions, including 23 nevi, 8 melanomas, 17 skin tumours and other skin lesions by 3 independent observers.
RESULTS: In the preliminary study, three epidermal descriptors and six descriptors for BCC were identified. The latter included aligned elongated cells, double alignment of cells, cell nests with palisading and phantom islands. From the test set, 56 BCCs were correctly diagnosed, whereas in 10 cases the diagnosis was 'other lesions'. However, it was always possible to exclude the diagnosis of BCC in healthy skin and other lesion samples. Thus, overall sensitivity of the method was 84.85, whereas a specificity of 100\% was observed with respect to both healthy skin and 'other lesions'.
CONCLUSIONS: This study describes new morphological descriptors of BCC enabling its characterization and its distinction from healthy skin and other skin lesions in ex vivo samples, and demonstrates for the first time that MPT represents a sensitive and specific technique for the diagnosis of BCC.},

	abstract = {Multiphoton laser scanning microscopy (MPLSM) is based on non-resonant simultaneous absorption of two or three near infrared (NIR) photons by a fluorophore in the subfemtoliter focal volume of a high numerical aperture (N.A. 1.3) objective. The higher penetration depth of NIR radiation enables optical sectioning across thick biological specimens and because of the absence of efficient single photon absorbers in the NIR spectral region of 700 to 1200 nm there is hardly any out-of-focus photodamage and photobleaching. Recent in vitro studies (14) have demonstrated that irradiation of supercoiled plasmid DNA with intense multiphoton NIR 810 nm of 140 fs pulse width, 76 MHz pulse repetition rate results in single strand breaks as a result of simultaneous absorption of three or more photons. Herein, we have investigated the influence of 800 nm NIR 170 fs laser pulses, 80 MHz pulse repetition frequency at mean powers of 2 to 20 mW on nuclear DNA of unlabelled PtK2 cells. In situ TdT-mediated dUTP-nick end labelling (TUNEL) revealed that cells exposed to the NIR irradiation above {\textgreater} or =5 mW mean laser power alone contained TUNEL-positive nuclei. The intensity of TUNEL fluorescence was relatively higher at increased mean NIR laser power. These results provide evidence that DNA strand breaks also occur in vivo when mammalian cells are exposed to high average power {\textgreater} or =5 mW NIR irradiation during MPLSM possibly due to multiphoton absorption process. Because intense DNA fragmentation is one of the hall marks of programmed cell death it is hypothesised that NIR induced cell death is by apoptosis.},

Intrastromal linear scanning at higher power resulted in luminescent plasma along the scanning line. Lesion width decreased with increasing tissue depth and increased with increasing laser power at the target. Light microscopy showed intact stromal tissue around the area of the lesion.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate femtosecond laser-assisted nanosurgery of the anterior lens capsule in a prospective in vitro study.
METHODS: Eight anterior lens capsules obtained during conventional phaco surgery were irradiated with a nonamplified 80-MHz near-infrared 800-nm titanium:sapphire femtosecond laser. Line intratissue laser cuts were examined by femtosecond multiphoton laser scanning microscopy (MLSM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
RESULTS: Speed parameters of the laser beam, laser ablation time, and pulse power determined the width of the lesions, which ranged from 220±40 nm (SD) to 1.49±0.15 µm. Both MLSM and TEM revealed minimal collateral alterations in the tissue surrounding the laser cuts.
CONCLUSIONS: Nonamplified near-infrared femtosecond laser pulses at low pulse energies may be a promising strategy for precise noncontact nanosurgery of the anterior lens capsule with minimal collateral damage to surrounding tissue. High-resolution MLSM offers 3-dimensional, noninvasive, nondestructive imaging at submicrometer resolution within seconds before and after ablation.},

Collagenous structures were selectively imaged by detection of second harmonic generation (SHG). Additionally, routine histology and electron microscopy were integrated to verify the observed results.

METHODS: A solid-state Ti:Sapphire femtosecond laser system was integrated in an inverted JenLab Femt-O-Cut laser scanning microscope. A diffraction-limited 40x objective was used to induce multiphoton ionization and plasma production. New Zealand albino rabbits and porcine eyes were used. Surgical outcomes were determined using frame and line scans with nanojoule pulses at a wavelength of 800 nm.
RESULTS: Surgical performance was assessed by optical imaging, histology, and electron microscopy. No significant corneal turbidity was observed. Optical imaging and histological examinations detected virtually no perturbation in the surrounding tissue. Corneal flaps and stromal lenticules were generated. Wound repair of the unlifted flaps was observed up to 90 days postoperatively.
CONCLUSIONS: Surgical results and follow-up studies confirm that this femtosecond laser at nanojoule pulse energy is able to generate corneal flaps precisely, without causing visible collateral damage to the surrounding tissue or overlying epithelium.},

	abstract = {Two-photon excitation-based near-infrared (NIR) laser scanning microscopy is currently emerging as a new and versatile alternative to conventional confocal laser scanning microscopy, particularly for vital cell imaging in life sciences. Although this innovative microscopy has several advantages such as highly localized excitation, higher penetration depth, reduced photobleaching and photodamage, and improved signal to noise ratio, it has, however, recently been evidenced that high-power NIR laser irradiation can drastically inhibit cell division and induce cell death. In the present study we have investigated the cellular responses of unlabeled rat kangaroo kidney epithelium (PtK2) cells to NIR femtosecond laser irradiation. We demonstrate that NIR 170-fs laser pulses operating at 80-MHz pulse repetition frequency and at mean power of {\textgreater} or = 7 mW evoke generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as H2O2 that can be visualized in situ by standard in vivo cytochemical analysis using Ni-3,3'-diaminobenzidine (Ni-DAB) as well as with a recently developed fluorescent probe Jenchrom px blue. The formation of the Ni-DAB reaction product as well as that of Jenchrom was relatively more pronounced when irradiated cells were incubated in alkaline solution (pH 8) than in those incubated in acidic solution (pH 6), suggesting peroxisomal localization of these reaction products. Two-photon time-lapse imaging of the internalization of the cell impermeate fluorescent dye propidium iodide revealed that the integrity of the plasma membrane of NIR irradiated cells is drastically compromised. Visualization of the nuclei with DNA-specific fluorescent probes such as 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole 24 h postirradiation further provided tangible evidence that the nuclei of these cells undergo several deformations and eventual fragmentation. That these NIR irradiated cells die by apoptosis has been established by in situ detection of DNA strand breaks using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling method. Because the reactive oxygen species such as H2O2 and OH* can cause noxious effects such as cell membrane injury by peroxidation of polyunsaturated lipids and proteins and oxidative phosphorylation, and alterations of ATP-dependent Ca2+ pumps, these ROS are likely to contribute to drastic cytological alterations observed in this study following NIR irradiation. Taken together, we have established that NIR laser irradiations at mean power {\textgreater} or = 7 mW delivered at pulse duration time of 170 fs generally used in two- and multiphoton microscopes cause oxidative stress (1) evoking production of ROS, (2) resulting in membrane barrier dysfunction, (3) inducing structural deformations and fragmentation of the nuclei as well as DNA strand breaks, (4) leading to cell death by apoptosis.},

By focusing of the laser beam with high-numerical-aperture objectives of a scanning microscope to diffraction-limited spots and with light intensities of terawatts per cubic centimeter, precise submicrometer holes and cuts in human chromosomes have been processed by single-point exposure and line scans. A minimum FWHM cut size of {\textasciitilde}100 nm during a partial dissection of chromosome 1, which is below the diffraction-limited spot size, and a minimum material removal of {\textasciitilde}0.003mum (3) were determined by a scanning-force microscope. The plasma-induced ablated material corresponds to {\textasciitilde}1/400 of the chromosome 1 volume and to {\textasciitilde}65x10(3) base pairs of chromosomal DNA. A complete dissection could be performed with FWHM cut sizes below 200 nm. High-repetition-frequency femtosecond lasers at low mean power in combination with high-numerical-aperture focusing optics appear therefore as appropriate noncontact tools for nanoprocessing of bulk and (or) surfaces of transparent materials such as chromosomes.

Both methods relay on intrinsic contrast mechanisms and dispense with the need of staining. In the acoustic part of the microscope, a gigahertz ultrasound wave is generated by an acoustic lens and the reflected sound energy is detected by the identical lens in a confocal setup. The achieved lateral resolution is in the range of 1 mum. Contrast in the images arises mainly from the local absorption of sound in the cells related to viscose damping. Additionally, acoustic microscopy can access the sound speed as well as the acoustic impedance of the cell membrane and the cell shape, as it is an intrinsic volume scanning technique. The multiphoton image formation bases on the detection of autofluorescence due to endogenous fluorophores. The nonlinearity of two-photon absorption provides submicron lateral and axial resolution without the need of confocal optical detection. In addition, in the near-IR cell damages are drastically reduced in comparison with direct excitation in the visible or UV. The presented setup was aligned with a dedicated procedure to ensure identical image areas. Combined multiphoton/acoustic images of living myoblast cells are discussed focusing on the reliability of the method.},

In combination with confocal detection 3D images with submicron spatial resolution can be obtained. Moreover, CeIV-perhydroxide, CeIV-perhydroxy-phosphate, CeIV-DAB complexes and catechol-DAB polymers are highly absorptive. Among other additives, especially stable nitroxyl radicals led to a distinct improvement of the DAB staining in terms of sensitivity and proper localization. This was proven in addition by means of blotting a horseradish peroxidase dilution series during several experiments. In sections it was easily possible to record reflectance signals and high transmission contrast at the wavelength of the exciting argon ion laser (preferentially 488 nm). The results of an imbibition study of cerium-containing model precipitates indicate that the cerium generally should be oxidized prior to observation because the index of refraction of CeIV compounds is considerably higher than that of the corresponding CeIII compounds. A comparative numerical assessment of reflection intensities from reflectant parts in morphologically similar sections is possible. Confocal laser scanning microscopy offers a unique way for high resolution detection of primary histochemical reaction products being sufficiently reflective and/or absorptive.

	abstract = {In the present work, the authors investigated ultrastructural changes as well as the reproduction behaviour of preselected single CHO-K1 cells exposed to 170 femtosecond laser pulses at different power output levels in comparison with cells outside the illumination volume. The ultrashort laser pulses were provided by an 80 MHz Ti:sapphire laser at 780 nm. The cells were scanned ten times with a scan rate of 1/16 s(-1). Single CHO-K1 cells exposed to low mean power of 2 mW revealed no significant changes in ultrastructure after laser exposure. In some cases, changes of mitochondria with slight disordering of cristae were found. Cytoplasm was filled with vesicles that seemed to be released from Golgi stacks. Cells irradiated with higher powers demonstrated more dramatic changes in ultrastructure. A considerable number of swollen mitochondria in conjunction with loss of cristae was observed. The main event of mitochondrial changes was the formation of electron dense bodies in the mitochondrial matrix. In addition, lumen of endoplasmatic reticulum was enlarged. Highest applied mean laser power of 12.5 mW lead to complete destruction of mitochondria and their transformation to electron dense structures containing membrane material. Compared with cell targets irradiated with 2 mW mean power, the release of vesicles from Golgi stacks seemed to be rather moderate. Cells localised outside the laser beam revealed no ultrastructural changes. Low mean laser power at 2 mW was unable to impair the reproduction behaviour of CHO-K1 cells. At higher laser power output levels, CHO-K1 cells started to delay cell division. At 12.5 mW, no cell division occurred. The obtained results may be helpful in recommending parameters for safe femtosecond laser microscopy of living specimens.},

MRI maps density and mobility of molecules tracking specific molecular signatures. Multiphoton imaging profits from the nonlinear absorption of light in the focus of a femtosecond laser source stimulating the autofluorescence of biomolecules. As this effect relies on a high light intensity, the accessible field of view is limited, but the resolution is very high (a few hundred nanometers). Here, we aim to link the different accessible scales and properties addressed in the different techniques to obtain a synoptic view. As model specimen we studied embryos of barley. Multiphoton stimulated autofluorescence images and images of second harmonic generation are achieved even down to low magnification (10x), low numerical aperture (N.A. 0.25) conditions. The overview images allowed morphological assignments and fluorescence lifetime imaging provides further information to identify accumulation of endogenous fluorophores. The second, complementary contribution from high-resolution MR images provides a 3D model and shows the embedding of the embryo in the grain. Images of the proton density were acquired using a standard 3D spin-echo imaging pulse sequence. Details directly comparable to the low magnification optical data are visible. Eventually, passing from the MR images of the whole grain via low magnification to high resolution autofluorescence data bridges the scale barrier, and might provide the possibility to trace transport and accumulation of, e.g., nutrients from large structure of the plant to the (sub-) cellular level.},

METHODS: Pulmonary valves were excised from unprocessed porcine hearts under sterile conditions. After treatment with antibiotics, the valves were incubated in a cryoprotective solution, cryopreserved stepwise, and stored at -196 degrees C for 1 week. Two groups of heart valves (fresh untreated and thawed cryopreserved [each, n = 8]) were analyzed using biochemical (collagen, elastin, desmosine), histologic (hematoxylin-eosin, Movat-pentachrome, resorcin-fuchsin), and immunohistochemical (antibodies against collagen I, III, IV, and elastin) methods. Near-infrared femtosecond multiphoton laser scanning microscopy and second harmonic generation were used for high-resolution three-dimensional imaging of ECM structures.
RESULTS: Biochemical testing demonstrated similar amounts of collagen and desmosine, but a minor loss of elastin in the cryopreserved specimens. Conventional histology revealed almost comparable cell and ECM formations in fresh and cryopreserved valve leaflets. In contrast, laser-induced autofluorescence imaging showed substantial ultrastructural deterioration and disintegration of most collagenous structures. Second harmonic generation was not inducible.
CONCLUSIONS: Conventional cryopreservation of heart valves is accompanied by serious alterations and destruction of leaflet ECM structures, specifically demonstrated by multiphoton imaging. Further in-depth studies to clarify the impact of alternative cryopreservation techniques proposed for clinical use, such as vitrification, are crucial.},

A controllable, parallel, highly efficient and very local heat conversion of the incident laser light into metal nanoparticles without ablation or fragmentation provides the means for a tool like a 'nanoreactor', a 'nanowelder', a 'nanocrystallizer' or a 'nanodesorber'. In this paper we explain theoretically and show experimentally the interaction of laser radiation with gold nanoparticles on a polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) layer (one-photon excitation) by means of different laser pulse lengths, wavelengths and pulse repetition rates. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report showing the possibility of highly local (in a 40 nm range) regulated heat insertion into the nanoparticle and its surroundings without ablation of the gold nanoparticles. In an earlier paper we showed that near-infrared femtosecond irradiation can cut labeled DNA sequences in metaphase chromosomes below the diffraction-limited spot size. Now, we use gold as well as silver-enhanced gold nanoparticles on DNA (also within chromosomes) as energy coupling objects for femtosecond laser irradiation with single-and two-photon excitation. We show the results of highly localized destruction effects on DNA that occur only nearby the nanoparticles.},

TE constructs were fabricated from decellularized porcine pulmonary valves, seeded ovine arterial cells and subsequent 16 days dynamic in vitro culture using a pulsatile bioreactor. Native and TE valves were studied by histology (hematoxylin-eosin, resorcin-fuchsin, Movat pentachrome), NIR femtosecond multiphoton laser scanning microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Cells of native and TE tissues were identified and localized by immunohistochemistry. Arterial, valvular and re-isolated TE-construct cells were processed for immunocytochemistry and Western blotting. ECM analysis and SEM revealed characteristical and comparable structures in native and TE leaflets. Most cells in native leaflets stained strongly positive for vimentin. Cells positive to alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), myosin and calponin were only found at the ventricular (inflow) side of ovine aortic and porcine pulmonary valve leaflets. Cells from TE constructs had a strong expression of vimentin, alpha-SMA, myosin, calponin and h-caldesmon throughout the entire leaflet. Comparable ECM formation and endothelial cell lining of native and TE leaflets could be demonstrated. However, immunostaining revealed significant differences between valvular cell phenotypes of native and TE leaflets.

Objective of this study was to investigate the impact of different decellularization protocols on extracellular matrix integrity of xenogeneic tissue by means of multiphoton femtosecond laser scanning microscopy, biochemical and histological analysis. Pulmonary valves were dissected from porcine hearts and placed in a solution of trypsin-EDTA and incubated at 37 degrees C for either 5, 8, or 24 h, followed by a 24 h PBS washing. Native and decellularized valves were processed for histology, DNA, cell proliferation, matrix proteins and biomechanical testing. Multiphoton NIR laser microscopy has been applied for high-resolution 3D imaging of collagen and elastin. Distinct differences in several ECM components following decellularization time were observed. Total GAG contents decreased in a time-dependent manner, with o-sulfated GAGs being more susceptible to degradation than n-sulfated GAGs. Efficiency of insoluble collagen extraction increased proportionally with decellularization time, suggesting ECM-integrity may be compromised with prolonged incubation. Biomechanical testing revealed a gradual weakening of mechanical strength with increased decellularization time. The enzymatic decellularization process of heart valves revealed a time-dependent loss of cells, ECM components and biomechanical strength. In order to avoid any immune response a thorough decellularization of 24 h remains mandatory.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to demonstrate the effects of selected plant extracts in a cosmetic cream on the dermal network components after a 3-month treatment using an in vivo multiphoton tomographic device.
METHODS: Twenty-four Caucasian women aged between 45 and 65 applied randomly a cosmetic emulsion B containing active ingredients (soy and jasmine) twice a day on one arm and its vehicle A (without active ingredients) on the other arm during 3 months. Measurements were performed on the internal side of the forearm before starting the treatment (T0), after 4 week (T4) and 12 weeks (T12) treatment. Measurements consisted of a multi-layers acquisitions using a multiphoton tomograph with subcellular resolution. Optical sections (about 6 microm thick) were recorded from 0 to about 200 microm using two different wavelengths: 760 and 820 nm. To compare the series of images and obtain an objective quantification of the signal of second harmonic generation (SHG) and autofluorescence, the method used consisted of taking the integrated brightness of an image (same rectangular area for all images) as a measure of the signal. Following this step, a ratio between brightness of images from the area treated with cream A or B and brightness of untreated area was calculated and used as an assessment of treatment efficacy. The parameter used for statistical analysis (variance analysis) is the difference before and after 12 weeks of treatment by either cream A or B of the signal ratios calculated in the upper dermis (118-130 microm) and those from a deeper region of the upper dermis (165-178 microm).
RESULTS: Signals (autofluorescence+SHG) of extracellular matrix do not change significantly with time (weeks 0, 4 and 12) when cream A (vehicle with no active ingredient) is applied. Treatment with cream B results in an enhancement in the signal level of extracellular matrix at week 12. The comparison of signals, in both areas (118-130 microm and 160-178 microm), show an higher increase in the deeper region than in the more superficial one for product B while we do not notice any change with product A.
CONCLUSION: The multiphoton tomograph provided excellent high-resolution images, which describe clearly the different skin layers, single cells and extracellular matrix components in all the 24 volunteers. Statistic analyses reveal a real effect for product B with selected plant extracts, known to increase collagen synthesis. Changes observed are characteristics of modifications in dermal collagen and elastin content. To our knowledge, it is the first time that it was possible to demonstrate in vivo the effect of a cosmetic product on the superficial dermal layer, in a non-invasive and non-destructive process, i.e. without cutting the skin.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The functional R620W (c.1858C{\textgreater}T) variant of the protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor 22 gene (PTPN22) has been associated with a variety of autoimmune disorders. A recent study has suggested that R620W also contributes to the severe form of alopecia areata (AA).
OBJECTIVES: We sought to replicate the finding of an association between PTPN22 and severe AA. In addition, we wanted to study the effect of PTPN22 on the general risk to develop AA and on other subtypes of AA (mild AA, early/late age at onset, positive/negative family history).
METHODS: The R620W variant was genotyped in a large case-control sample of Belgian-German origin with 435 patients and 628 controls.
RESULTS: Significant results were obtained for the overall collective of patients with AA (P=0.007). Subdividing the sample according to severity of AA, family history and age at onset, we detected lowest P-values for patients with the severe form of AA (Pcorr=0.036), with a positive family history (Pcorr=0.042) and with an age at onset{\textless}or=20 years (Pcorr=0.048).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest the R620W variant of PTPN22 as a general risk factor in AA with the strongest effect observed among patients with a severe type of AA, a positive family history or an early onset of disease.},

	abstract = {Microtubules are obligate functional elements of almost all eukaryotic cells. They are involved in a broad range of essential cellular functions and structural changes of this system may trigger cell death. Recently, we have reported that lipopolysaccharides inhibit in vitro microtubule formation due to exclusion of microtubule-associated proteins. The distinct epitopes of lipopolysaccharides responsible for these effects and the in vivo relevance of these data are unknown. Therefore, this study was conducted to elucidate the effects of lipid A, the biologically active motif of lipopolysaccharides, on microtubule formation in vitro and to prove whether lipopolysaccharides affect the microtubule architecture of cultured human monocytes in vivo. Despite a dose- and pH-dependent inhibition of microtubule formation by lipopolysaccharides, inhibition of microtubule assembly could be mimicked by lipid A. Near-infrared two-photon microscopy revealed that human peripheral blood monocytes accumulate lipopolysaccharides. A vesicular distribution pattern of lipopolysaccharides within the monocytes was observed. Confocal laser scanning microscopy demonstrated alterations in the microtubule architecture of monocytes after incubation with lipopolysaccharides. Lipid A seems to be responsible for the observed crosstalk between lipopolysaccharides and microtubule proteins. Furthermore, our data indicate that lipopoly-saccharides may affect the microtubule architecture in human monocytes after intracellular accumulation directly. Therefore, we conclude, that the microtubule cytoskeleton is an essential intracellular target for sepsis-relevant bacterial components such as lipopolysaccharides.},

In the first set of experiments the transcriptional response of the two transcription factors ERF6 and ERF105 that had previously been shown to rapidly respond to light was shown to be deregulated in the pad2 mutant but not in the vtc1 background. The transcriptional response after combining the low-to-high light transfer with methylviologen pretreatment further demonstrated the significance of glutathione in strongly modulating the retrograde response. Transcripts encoding small heat shock proteins (HSP17.4, HSP176a, HSP20-like1 and HSP20-like2) and the lipid transfer protein LTP3 were taken as markers responding to the combinatorial treatment in wild type, and most strongly in pad2 in high light or upon methylviologen treatment.

To investigate the incidence of genetically confirmed SMA, and the number of patients who are able and approachable to participate in new clinical trials and observational research, we used both genetic laboratories, the TREAT-NMD Global SMA Patient Registry and the Care and Trial Sites Registry (CTSR). In Europe, 4653 patients were genetically diagnosed by the genetic laboratories in the 5-year period 2011 to 2015, with 992 diagnosed in 2015 alone. The data provide an estimated incidence of SMA in Europe of 1 in 3900-16,000 live births. Patient numbers in the national patient registries and CTSR were considerably lower. By far, most patients registered in the national patient registries and the CTSR live in Europe and are reported to have SMA type II. Considerable differences between countries in patient participation in the registries were observed. Our findings indicate that not all patients with SMA are accessed by specialist healthcare services and these patients may not have access to research opportunities and optimal care.},

Dwell times of PICC with elective versus non-elective removal, risk of non-elective removal of PICC according to tip position, and differences between upper versus lower limb catheter insertion were analysed. 33.8\% PICC were removed non-electively. Median (IQR) dwell time was 193 (142-287) versus 154 (102-260) h for elective versus non-elective removal (p {\textless} 0.001). Non-elective removal was more common for lower limb insertion sites: 41 versus 31\% (p = 0.002). PICC were significantly more likely to be removed non-electively when located in the axillary (odds ratio (OR) 2.08), cephalic (OR 8.93), external iliac (OR 4.99), and femoral (OR 10.31) vein.
CONCLUSION: In this cohort, dwell times of 1FR-PICC lines removed non-electively were similar to 1.9- or 2.0FR-PICC. PICC tips positioned in the axillary, cephalic, external iliac, and femoral veins had a higher risk of non-elective removal. What is Known: •Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC) are widely used in neonatal intensive care. •Previous studies focused on 2-French PICC and newborns of all gestational ages. What is New: •Dwell times of 1-French PICC removed non-electively were similar to 2-French PICC. •1-French PICC tips positioned more peripherally had a higher risk of non-elective removal.},

	abstract = {Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is often complicated by pulmonary hypertension (PH). We investigated three biomarkers potentially suitable as screening markers for extremely preterm infants at risk of BPD-associated PH. In this prospective observational cohort study conducted in a tertiary neonatal intensive care unit, 83 preterm infants with BPD born {\textless}28-wk gestation and still inpatients at 36-wk corrected age received an echocardiogram and blood tests of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), troponin I, and YKL-40. Infants were analyzed according to echocardiographic evidence of tricuspid regurgitation (TR). Thirty infants had evidence of TR on echocardiogram at 36-wk corrected age. Infants with or without TR had similar baseline demographics: mean ± SD gestational age 26(1) ± 1(2) vs. 26(1) ± 1(1) wk and birth weight 830 ± 206 vs. 815 ± 187 g, respectively. There was no difference in duration of respiratory support. The right ventricular systolic pressure of infants with evidence of TR was 40 ± 16 mmHg. BNP was the only biomarker that proved to be significantly higher in infants with evidence of TR: median (interquartile range) serum level 54.5 (35-105) vs. 41.5 (30-59) pg/ml, P = 0.043. Subgroup analysis of infants with severe BPD requiring discharge on home oxygen or BPD-related mortality revealed similar results. There was no difference between groups for troponin I and YKL-40. In conclusion, increased serum levels of BNP were associated with evidence of TR at 36-wk corrected gestational age in extremely preterm infants, suggesting a potential role as a screening biomarker for BPD-associated PH.},

Identification of mutations contributing to aberrant activation of signaling cascades in ATC may provide novel opportunities for targeted therapy. Thirty-nine ATC samples were studied by next-generation sequencing (NGS) with an established gene panel. High quality readout was obtained in 30/39 ATC. Twenty-eight ATC harbored a mutation in at least one of the studied genes: TP53 (18/30), NF1 (11/30), ALK (6/30), NRAS (4/30), ATRX (3/30), BRAF (2/30), HRAS (2/30), KRAS (1/30). In 17/30 ATC (54 \%) mutations were found in two or more genes. Twenty-one of the identified variants are listed in COSMIC as somatic mutations reported in other cancer entities. In three ATC samples no mutations were detected and none of the ATCs was positive for BRAF(V600E). The most frequent mutations were found in TP53 (60 \%), followed by NF1 (37 \%). ALK mutations were detected in 20 \% of ATC and were more frequent than RAS or BRAF mutations. ATRX mutations were identified in 10 \% of the ATC samples. These sequencing data from 30 ATC samples demonstrate the accumulation of genetic alterations in ATC because in 90 \% of samples mutations were already found in the investigated nine genes alone. Mutations were found with high prevalence in established tumor suppressor and oncogenes in ATC, such as TP53 and H/K/NRAS, but also, although less frequent, in genes that may harbor the potential for targeted treatment in a subset of ATC patients, such as ALK and NF1.},

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We analyzed tumor biopsies from seven patients obtained before, during, and/or after treatment with AZD9291 or rociletinib (CO-1686). Targeted sequencing and FISH analyses were performed, and the relevance of candidate genes was functionally assessed in in vitro models.
RESULTS: We found recurrent amplification of either MET or ERBB2 in tumors that were resistant or developed resistance to third-generation EGFR inhibitors and show that ERBB2 and MET activation can confer resistance to these compounds. Furthermore, we identified a KRAS(G12S) mutation in a patient with acquired resistance to AZD9291 as a potential driver of acquired resistance. Finally, we show that dual inhibition of EGFR/MEK might be a viable strategy to overcome resistance in EGFR-mutant cells expressing mutant KRAS CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that heterogeneous mechanisms of resistance can drive primary and acquired resistance to third-generation EGFR inhibitors and provide a rationale for potential combination strategies.

	issn = {1710-1484},
	doi = {10.1186/s13223-016-0123-3},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Being one of the most common nasal diseases, chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is subdivided into CRS with nasal polyps (NP) and CRS without nasal polyps (CRSsNP). CRSsNP presents itself with a TH1 milieu and neutrophil infiltration, while NP is characterised by a mixed TH1/TH2 profile and an influx of predominantly eosinophils, plasma cells and mast cells. For the purpose of discovering disease-specific cytokine profiles, the present study compares levels of mediators and cytokines in nasal secretions between CRSsNP, NP, and healthy controls.
METHODS: The study included 45 participants suffering from NP, 48 suffering from CRSsNP and 48 healthy controls. Allergic rhinitis constituted an exclusion criterion. Nasal secretions, sampled using the cotton wool method, were analysed for IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, IL-17, IL-8, GM-CSF, G-CSF, IFN-γ, MCP-1, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, eotaxin, and RANTES, and for ECP and tryptase, using Bio-Plex Cytokine assay or ELISA, respectively.
RESULTS: Elevated levels of IL-5, IL-17, G-CSF, MCP-1, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, ECP, and tryptase, as well as decreased levels of IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, and IFN-γ were detected in NP. CRSsNP presented increased levels of RANTES and MIP-1β while IL-13 was decreased. No differences between the three groups were found for IL-4, IL-8, GM-CSF, and eotaxin.
CONCLUSIONS: The present work suggests a disequilibrium of TH1 and TH2, together with a down-regulation of regulatory T lymphocytes and up-regulated TH17 in NP. Moreover, elevated levels of diverse mediators represent the activation of various inflammatory cells in this disease entity. The inflammation in CRSsNP, however, is only weakly depicted in nasal secretions. Therefore, cytokines in nasal secretions may provide helpful information for differential diagnosis.},

This study investigated the potential association of BNP and N-terminal-pro-BNP (NTproBNP) and PH within the first 72 hr of life in very preterm infants.
METHODS: Preterm infants {\textless}32 weeks gestational age who received an echocardiogram within the first 72 hr of life were eligible. BNP and NTproBNP were sampled at the time of the echocardiogram. Right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) was calculated as a surrogate marker of PH. Simple and multiple linear regression analysis was performed to examine associations and potential confounding factors.
RESULTS: Sixty-one infants were included with a median (IQR) birth weight of 983 g (826-1,167) and a median (IQR) gestational age of 27(2) weeks (26(2) -28(6) ). There was no difference between BNP or NTproBNP levels for infants with or without measurable RVSP. There was no significant correlation of BNP and RVSP in multiple linear regression analysis (regression coefficient -0.0035 (95\%CI: -0.020 to 0.013), P = 0.67). Also, NTproBNP and RVSP were not significantly correlated in multiple linear regression analysis (regression coefficient 0.0071 (95\%CI: -0.019 to 0.033), P = 0.58).

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury is a disease pattern that is associated with an acute inflammatory reaction. It is well known that neutrophils play an essential role in the early phase of hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury and determine the extent of tissue damage. Hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury can result in organ failure, which is linked to high mortality. Recent data indicate that the neuronal guidance receptor Plexin C1 is involved in the control of the acute inflammatory response and, as such, modulates the transmigration of neutrophils. Hence, we investigated the functional role of Plexin C1 in a mouse model of early hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury.
DESIGN: Animal study.
SETTING: University experimental laboratory.
SUBJECTS: Wild-type, PLXNC1 and chimeric mice.
INTERVENTIONS: Hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury or sham operation.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We found that the functional inhibition of Plexin C1 in wild-type mice treated with an anti-Plexin C1 antibody and a Semaphorin 7A peptide reduced hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury, as measured by the levels of lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate, and alanine aminotransferase. This reduction in ischemia-reperfusion injury was accompanied by reduced numbers of neutrophils in ischemic hepatic tissue and reduced serum levels of inflammatory cytokines. Experiments using Plexin C1 receptor-deficient (PLXNC1) mice also demonstrated decreased hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury. Studies of chimeric mice revealed that the hematopoietic Plexin C1 knockout is crucial for reducing the extent of hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury.
CONCLUSIONS: These results describe a role for Plexin C1 during ischemia-reperfusion injury, highlight the role of hematopoietic Plexin C1 in the development of hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury, and suggest that Plexin C1 is a potential drug target.},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of patients with unknown EGFR mutation status and long-term response (LTR) to gefitinib in the Swiss Iressa expanded access program (EAP). We assessed patient characteristics, and performed Sanger sequencing and next generation sequencing on archived tumor tissue. We hypothesized that EGFR mutations are prevalent in patients with LTR.
RESULTS: Of 430 patients in the EAP, 18 (4\%) fulfilled our definition of LTR, and 16 of them had archived tumor tissue. Patient characteristics were as expected for age, sex, and smoking history. Median duration of therapy was 38 months (range 24-142 months). Sanger sequencing revealed EGFR exon 18-21 mutations in 6 (38\%) of the tumors. Next generation sequencing revealed no further EGFR-mutated cases, but reported in 15 (94\%) of the tumors mutations in other genes (ALK, BRAF, DDR2, KEAP1, MET, PTEN, STK11) previously associated with NSCLC.

	abstract = {Throughout the animal kingdom, sexual pheromones are used for the attraction of mates and as courtship signals but also enable sexual isolation between species. In the parasitic wasp Lariophagus distinguendus, male courtship behaviour consisting of wing fanning, antennal stroking of the female antenna, and head nodding stimulates female receptivity leading to copulation. Recently L. distinguendus was reported to consist of two different lineages, which are sexually isolated because males fail to elicit receptivity in foreign females. It is unclear, however, which part of the courtship behaviour triggers female receptivity and therefore could be a mechanism causing sexual isolation. Here we show that in L. distinguendus a nonvolatile male oral pheromone is essential to release the female receptivity signal. In contrast, male wing fanning and antennal contact play a minor role. Additionally, the composition of the oral pheromone depends on the developmental host and females learn the composition upon emergence from the host substrate. These results will enable more detailed work on oral sexual pheromones to answer the question of how they are involved in the speciation process of L. distinguendus and other parasitoid species, for a better understanding of the huge biodiversity in this group.},

Recent advances in identifying oncogenes by cancer whole genome sequencing improved the understanding of SCLC carcinogenesis. However, tumor material is often limited in the clinic. Thus, it is a compulsive issue to improve SCLC diagnostics by combining established immunohistochemistry and next generation sequencing. We implemented amplicon-based next generation deep sequencing in our routine diagnostics pipeline to analyze RB1, TP53, EP300 and CREBBP, frequently mutated in SCLC. Thereby, our pipeline combined routine SCLC histology and identification of somatic mutations. We comprehensively analyzed fifty randomly collected SCLC metastases isolated from trachea and lymph nodes in comparison to specimens derived from primary SCLC. SCLC lymph node metastases showed enhanced proliferation and frequently a collapsed keratin cytoskeleton compared to SCLC metastases isolated from trachea. We identified characteristic synchronous mutations in RB1 and TP53 and non-synchronous CREBBP and EP300 mutations. Our data showed the benefit of implementing deep sequencing into routine diagnostics. We here identify oncogenic drivers and simultaneously gain further insights into SCLC tumor biology.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: New therapeutic approaches with biologic agents such as anti-cytokine antibodies are currently on trial for the treatment of asthma, rhinosinusitis or allergic diseases necessitating patient selection by biomarkers. Allergic rhinitis (AR), affecting about 20 \% of the Canadian population, is an inflammatory disease characterised by a disequilibrium of T-lymphocytes and tissue eosinophilia. Aim of the present study was to describe distinct cytokine patterns in nasal secretion between seasonal and perennial AR (SAR/PAR), and healthy controls by comparing cytokines regulating T-cells or stimulating inflammatory cells, and chemokines.
METHODS: Nasal secretions of 44 participants suffering from SAR, 45 participants with PAR and 48 healthy controls were gained using the cotton wool method, and analysed for IL-1β, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, IL-17, GM-CSF, G-CSF, IFN-γ, MCP-1, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, eotaxin, and RANTES by Bio-Plex Cytokine Assay as well as for ECP and tryptase by UniCAP-FEIA.
RESULTS: Participants with SAR or PAR presented elevated levels of tryptase, ECP, MCP-1, and MIP-1β, while values of GM-CSF, G-CSF, IL-1β, and IL-6 did not differ from the controls. Increased levels of IL-5, eotaxin, MIP-1α, and IL-17 and decreased levels of IFN-γ, IL-12 and IL-10 were found in SAR only. RANTES was elevated in SAR in comparison to PAR. Interestingly, we found reduced levels of IL-4 in PAR and of IL-13 in SAR.
CONCLUSIONS: Elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines were seen in both disease entities. They were, however, more pronounced in SAR, indicating a higher degree of inflammation. This study suggests a downregulation of TH1 and Treg-lymphocytes and an upregulation of TH17 in SAR. Moreover, the results display a prominent role of eosinophils and mast cells in AR. The observed distinct cytokine profiles in nasal secretion may prove useful as a diagnostic tool helping to match patients to antibody therapies.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Molybdenum cofactor deficiency (MoCD) is characterised by early, rapidly progressive postnatal encephalopathy and intractable seizures, leading to severe disability and early death. Previous treatment attempts have been unsuccessful. After a pioneering single treatment we now report the outcome of the complete first cohort of patients receiving substitution treatment with cyclic pyranopterin monophosphate (cPMP), a biosynthetic precursor of the cofactor.
METHODS: In this observational prospective cohort study, newborn babies with clinical and biochemical evidence of MoCD were admitted to a compassionate-use programme at the request of their treating physicians. Intravenous cPMP (80-320 μg/kg per day) was started in neonates diagnosed with MoCD (type A and type B) following a standardised protocol. We prospectively monitored safety and efficacy in all patients exposed to cPMP.
FINDINGS: Between June 6, 2008, and Jan 9, 2013, intravenous cPMP was started in 16 neonates diagnosed with MoCD (11 type A and five type B) and continued in eight type A patients for up to 5 years. We observed no drug-related serious adverse events after more than 6000 doses. The disease biomarkers urinary S-sulphocysteine, xanthine, and urate returned to almost normal concentrations in all type A patients within 2 days, and remained normal for up to 5 years on continued cPMP substitution. Eight patients with type A disease rapidly improved under treatment and convulsions were either completely suppressed or substantially reduced. Three patients treated early remain seizure free and show near-normal long-term development. We detected no biochemical or clinical response in patients with type B disease.
INTERPRETATION: cPMP substitution is the first effective therapy for patients with MoCD type A and has a favourable safety profile. Restoration of molybdenum cofactor-dependent enzyme activities results in a greatly improved neurodevelopmental outcome when started sufficiently early. The possibility of MoCD type A needs to be urgently explored in every encephalopathic neonate to avoid any delay in appropriate cPMP substitution, and to maximise treatment benefit.

Based on murine models, neuroendocrine stem cells of the terminal bronchioli have been postulated as the cellular origin of primary SCLC. However, both in lung and many other organs, combined small cell/non-small cell tumors and secondary transitions from non-small cell carcinomas upon cancer therapy to neuroendocrine and small cell tumors occur. We define features of "small cell-ness" based on neuroendocrine markers, characteristic RB1 and TP53 mutations and small cell morphology. Furthermore, here we identify a pathway driving the pathogenesis of secondary SCLC involving inactivating NOTCH mutations, activation of the NOTCH target ASCL1 and canonical WNT-signaling in the context of mutual bi-allelic RB1 and TP53 lesions. Additionally, we explored ASCL1 dependent RB inactivation by phosphorylation, which is reversible by CDK5 inhibition. We experimentally verify the NOTCH-ASCL1-RB-p53 signaling axis in vitro and validate its activation by genetic alterations in vivo. We analyzed clinical tumor samples including SCLC, SCC and pulmonary large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas and adenocarcinomas using amplicon-based Next Generation Sequencing, immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization. In conclusion, we identified a novel pathway underlying rare secondary SCLC which may drive small cell carcinomas in organs other than lung, as well.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The Network Genomic Medicine Lung Cancer was set up to rapidly translate scientific advances into early clinical trials of targeted therapies in lung cancer performing molecular analyses of more than 3500 patients annually. Because sequential analysis of the relevant driver mutations on fixated samples is challenging in terms of workload, tissue availability, and cost, we established multiplex parallel sequencing in routine diagnostics. The aim was to analyze all therapeutically relevant mutations in lung cancer samples in a high-throughput fashion while significantly reducing turnaround time and amount of input DNA compared with conventional dideoxy sequencing of single polymerase chain reaction amplicons.
METHODS: In this study, we demonstrate the feasibility of a 102 amplicon multiplex polymerase chain reaction followed by sequencing on an Illumina sequencer on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue in routine diagnostics. Analysis of a validation cohort of 180 samples showed this approach to require significantly less input material and to be more reliable, robust, and cost-effective than conventional dideoxy sequencing. Subsequently, 2657 lung cancer patients were analyzed.
RESULTS: We observed that comprehensive biomarker testing provided novel information in addition to histological diagnosis and clinical staging. In 2657 consecutively analyzed lung cancer samples, we identified driver mutations at the expected prevalence. Furthermore we found potentially targetable DDR2 mutations at a frequency of 3\% in both adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas.
CONCLUSION: Overall, our data demonstrate the utility of systematic sequencing analysis in a clinical routine setting and highlight the dramatic impact of such an approach on the availability of therapeutic strategies for the targeted treatment of individual cancer patients.},

	abstract = {Assessment of lameness prevalence and severity requires visual evaluation of thelocomotion of a cow. Welfare schemes including locomotion assessments are increasingly being adopted, and more farmers and their veterinarians might implement a locomotion-scoring routine together. However, high within-observer agreement is a prerequisite for obtaining valid mobility scorings, and within-observer agreement cannot be estimated in a barn, because the gait of cows is dynamic and may change between 2 occasions. The objective of this study was to estimate the within-observer agreement according to the observers' educational background and experience with cattle, based on video recordings with very diverse types of gait. Groups of farmers, bovine veterinarians, first- and fourth-year veterinary students, researchers, and cattle-inexperienced sensory assessors evaluated mobility using a 5-point mobility score system developed specifically for walking cows (n=102 observers). The evaluation sessions were similar for all groups, lasted 75 min, and were organized as follows: introduction, test A, short training session, break, and test B. In total, video recordings of 22 cows were displayed twice in a random order (11 cows in each test × 2 replicates). Data were analyzed applying kappa coefficient, logistic regression, and testing for random effects of observers. The crude estimates of 95\% confidence interval for weighted kappa in test A and B ranged, respectively, from 0.76 to 0.80 and 0.70 to 0.75. When adjusting for the fixed effects of video sample and gait scoring preferences, the probability of assigning the same mobility score twice to the same cow varied from 55\% (sensory assessors) to 72\% (fourth-year veterinary students). The random effect of the individual observers was negligible. That is, in general observers could categorize the mobility characteristics of cows quite well. Observers who preferred to assess the attributes back arch or the overall mobility score (based on uneven gait) had the highest agreement, respectively, 69 or 68\%. The training session seemed insufficient to improve agreement. Nonetheless, even novice observers were able to achieve perfect agreement up to 60\% of the 22 scorings with merely the experience obtained during the study (introduction and training session). The relatively small differences between groups, together with a high agreement, demonstrate that the new system is easy to follow compared with previously described scoring systems. The mobility score achieves sufficiently high within-observer repeatability to allow between-observer agreement estimates, which are reliable compared with other more-complex scoring systems. Consequently, the new scoring scale seems feasible for on-farm applications as a tool to monitor mobility within and between cows, for communication between farmers and veterinarians with diverse educational background, and for lamenessbenchmarking of herds.},

Following UE, a trial of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) may be considered if a neonate is showing adequate respiratory effort. This study investigated the success and failure rate of NIV management of neonates experiencing UE.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective single-center study of neonates experiencing UE in the NICU over a 9-year period. Reintubation within 12 hours of a trial of NIV following UE was defined as treatment failure. Short-term respiratory outcomes were analyzed for all infants plus the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia for preterm infants born less than 32 weeks' gestation.
RESULTS: A total of 43 patients were included. Of those, 30 infants were trialed on NIV following UE. Baseline demographics were similar between both the groups except for the oxygen requirement before UE. The NIV was successful in 20 and failed in 10 infants. Infants who failed a trial of the NIV were reintubated between 0.45 and 5.25 hours following UE. Respiratory outcomes in very preterm infants did not differ between groups.
CONCLUSION: A trial of NIV may be considered as a treatment option in preterm and term newborns experiencing UE in the NICU.},

	abstract = {Regulatory enforcement of forest conservation laws is often dismissed as an ineffective approach to reducing tropical forest loss. Yet, effective enforcement is often a precondition for alternative conservation measures, such as payments for environmental services, to achieve desired outcomes. Fair and efficient policies to reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD) will thus crucially depend on understanding the determinants and requirements of enforcement effectiveness. Among potential REDD candidate countries, Brazil is considered to possess the most advanced deforestation monitoring and enforcement infrastructure. This study explores a unique dataset of over 15 thousand point coordinates of enforcement missions in the Brazilian Amazon during 2009 and 2010, after major reductions of deforestation in the region. We study whether local deforestation patterns have been affected by field-based enforcement and to what extent these effects vary across administrative boundaries. Spatial matching and regression techniques are applied at different spatial resolutions. We find that field-based enforcement operations have not been universally effective in deterring deforestation during our observation period. Inspections have been most effective in reducing large-scale deforestation in the states of Mato Grosso and Pará, where average conservation effects were 4.0 and 9.9 hectares per inspection, respectively. Despite regional and actor-specific heterogeneity in inspection effectiveness, field-based law enforcement is highly cost-effective on average and might be enhanced by closer collaboration between national and state-level authorities.},

	abstract = {Central to the concept of ecological speciation is the evolution of ecotypes, i.e. groups of individuals occupying different ecological niches. However, the mechanisms behind the first step of separation, the switch of individuals into new niches, are unclear. One long-standing hypothesis, which was proposed for insects but never tested, is that early learning causes new ecological preferences, leading to a switch into a new niche within one generation. Here, we show that a host switch occurred within a parasitoid wasp, which is associated with the ability for early learning and the splitting into separate lineages during speciation. Lariophagus distinguendus consists of two genetically distinct lineages, most likely representing different species. One attacks drugstore beetle larvae (Stegobium paniceum (L.)), which were probably the ancestral host of both lineages. The drugstore beetle lineage has an innate host preference that cannot be altered by experience. In contrast, the second lineage is found on Sitophilus weevils as hosts and changes its preference by early learning. We conclude that a host switch has occurred in the ancestor of the second lineage, which must have been enabled by early learning. Because early learning is widespread in insects, it might have facilitated ecological divergence and associated speciation in this hyperdiverse group.},

METHODS: This prospective observational study included preterm infants born {\textless}32 weeks' gestation who had an echocardiogram performed within the first four days of life. Blood samples were taken simultaneously for BNP and NTproBNP measurements prior to echocardiographic examination.
RESULTS: Of the 60 infants recruited, 58 had complete data sets.

However, ultrashort laser pulses in the femtosecond range can also realize nanoprocessing, even when operating at higher wavelengths. Feature sizes one order of magnitude smaller than the laser wavelength or less, are feasible. Furthermore, 3D nanomachining can easily be performed, such as 3D two-photon lithography and STED lithography for rapid prototyping. In-bulk nanomachining in transparent materials can be performed in contrast to standard UV nanoprocessing. Deep sub-diffraction optical two-beam lithography with 9 nm feature size and 52 nm two-line resolution has been reported based on two-photon polymerization and single-photon inhibition [29]. All-diode-based, low-cost, compact turn-key femtosecond lasers will become available within the next years. This will significantly change the market for industrial nanomachining and non-linear imaging.},

	abstract = {Stem cell research attracts considerable attention in developmental biology, nanobiotechnology, and medicine. Since Maksimow’s landmark hypothesis on stem cells in 1909, hundreds of thousands of reports have been published in biology, medicine and biotechnology regarding stem cells, evidence of their considerable worth as a major research subject. Artificial stem cells such as ‘induced pluripotent stem cells’ (iPS cells), which morphologically and functionally resemble embryonic stem cells have been generated through the reprogramming of somatic cells for research purposes. Typically, optical techniques such as light microscopy in combination with fluorescent markers are applied, sometimes accompanied with fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), to characterize and isolate both tissue-specific stem and iPS cells. To date, modern laser-based techniques such as nonlinear multiphoton microscopy and optical transfection using femtosecond lasers are only used in a few laboratories. The application of innovative femtosecond laser techniques in stem cell research shall be the subject of this chapter. Of particular focus is the application of femtosecond laser microscopy (i) for imaging and characterization of stem cells with high spatial sub-cellular resolution; (ii) as a nanoscalpel for optical cleaning; and (iii) for transfection and optical reprogramming of cells.},

	abstract = {Two-photon lithography (or, more general, multiphoton lithography) is apt to produce three-dimensional structures with feature sizes below the diffraction limit set out by Abbe. This is due to chemical nonlinearities which are intrinsic to polymerization. However, if one wants to write two nanometric structures close together yet prevent those structures from merging, two-photon lithography basically turns out to be bound to the diffraction limit unless some specific tricks are applied, such as the use of “forgetting starters” which require, however, particularly slow scanning speeds. An appealing means of working around this problem is provided by STED lithography, where STimulated Emission is used to Deplete (STED) the polymerization starters in the outer rim of the point spread function, very similar to the way in which it is used in STED microscopy. After reviewing STED microscopy and introducing STED lithography and its current state-of-the-art in terms of minimal structure size (54 nm) and resolution (120 nm), and after touching on photo-optical switching techniques alternative to STED, the following application for biological and physiological research will be outlined. Using STED lithography, it is possible to write nanoanchors for antibodies which carry only one antibody per nanoanchor. This allows proteins to be displayed on a substrate surface in any arbitrary pattern and with utmost control over the surface density. A discussion of some current problems and possible further directions of research will conclude this chapter.},

	abstract = {We present the analysis of the optical properties of two different fs-laser-induced nanostructures which possess great potential for near-field applications due to their sub-100 nm features. The first structures are standing gold nanojets generated by irradiation of thin gold films with single pulses of fs-laser radiation. Due to their upright standing orientation, the characteristic extinction resonances of these nanojets are studied by grazing incidence infrared spectroscopy with p-polarized radiation. The resonance wavelength strongly depends on the lateral extent of the nanojet and can be tailored by adjusting the focusing numerical aperture and the applied pulse energy. The observed correlation between the lateral extent of the nanojet and the resonance wavelength is described by the monopole model of a linear antenna. The second type of structures under investigation are fs-laser-induced sub-wavelength ripples on silicon. Ripple structures of different geometrical shape are generated and coated with a thin gold film. Here, the metallic cover layer allows for the excitation of surface plasmons. Based on the generated surface profiles, the corresponding plasmonic resonances are simulated. Angle-resolved UV-VIS spectroscopy measurements are performed and the resulting plasmonic dispersion relation of these structures is compared to the calculated resonance conditions. The plasmonic resonances and additional experiments of the surface structures reveal insights into the localized or propagation nature of the plasmonic modes excited on generated surface profiles.},

By using small angle x-ray scattering and focused ion beam milling we were able to show that nanogratings consist of sheet-like cavities with dimensions of (280 × 25 × 380) nm(3) and (30 × 25 × 75) nm(3). Their size remains constant with an increasing number of laser pulses while the number of sheets increases. This is in agreement with the continuously decreasing period obtained by diffraction measurements and SEM images. Furthermore, nanogratings were inscribed on different types of glass, such as ULE™ or borosilicate glasses. Different nanograting features, such as sheet thickness and periodicity, were obtained in borosilicate. Theoretical studies reveal that wavelength-scale plasma structures form during the interaction of laser light with glass. Their competition leads to the formation of periodic plasma patterns, which show the same orientation and period as nanogratings in glass (at low pulse numbers). Finally, nanograting-based waveplates have been successfully implemented in single shot optical sectioning analysis using the polarized-illumination-coded structured illumination microscopy (picoSIM) method.},

This solution was simultaneously and consecutively polymerized yielding loaded hydrogels. The laser ablation process was investigated concerning the influence of different laser parameters on the ablation efficiency, including the determination of the cavitation bubble dynamics. The in situ fabrication of stable nanoparticle polymer composites, namely nanoparticle-loaded microgels, using the laser ablation method was established. The microgels described were immobilized by electrospinning in order to achieve surface modified microfibers. Electron microscopy and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry were used to characterize the suitability of the zinc nanoparticle-loaded microgels immobilized in microfibers for a zinc ion release over a period of five days without release of the nanoparticles. The amounts of ions and the release rates were regulated by variations of the composites used for the electrospinning process. Parallely, in vitro indirect biocompatibility and bioresponse tests showed no cytotoxicity not from the hydrogels nor from the microfibers. Cell proliferation was increased for both systems separately and for their combination. The ion releases of the iron and zinc nanoparticle-loaded microgels were too low to induce any subsequent effect on cell culture.},

Our approach focuses on inducing very localized photoreactions on an area much smaller than the diffraction-limited optical spot, using nonlinear optical effects in the near-fields of metallic nanoparticle (NP) antennae embedded in the polymer thin film. We thus illuminated the copolymers with 100 fs pulses at a 790 nm exciting wavelength in order to trigger photoreactions through nonlinear optical effects at around 400 nm. Spin coating the copolymers onto both y-cut lithium niobate (LNO) sample surfaces (which is an excellent SHG amplifier) and onto bare glass surfaces (no SHG) and then comparing the as-induced nonlinear optical photoreactions showed a direct two-photon absorption to be the dominant photoreaction mechanism, while SHG radiation (as emitted by LNO) did not show any significant influence. High efficiency of this process can be achieved by the near-field enhancement close to metallic NPs present in the polymer thin film. First evidence is given here with protected amine side groups when spin coating the copolymer over sharp gold edges as obtained from triangular metallic NPs (i.e. so-called Fischer pattern); after laser exposure at 790 nm, the photochemically deprotected amines were successfully photo-labeled and then imaged by STORM microscopy.},

	abstract = {Laser-induced periodic surface structures (LIPSS) were generated on two types of steel (100Cr6, X30CrMoN15-1) and two types of titanium (Ti, Ti6Al4V) surfaces upon irradiation with multiple linear polarized femtosecond laser pulses in air environment (pulse duration 30 fs, central wavelength 790 nm, pulse repetition rate 1 kHz, Gaussian beam shape). The conditions (laser fluence, spatial spot overlap) were optimized in a sample-scanning geometry for the processing of large surface areas covered homogeneously by two different types of LIPSS – either near wavelength or sub-100 nm structures. The tribological performance of the nanostructured surfaces was characterized under reciprocating sliding at 1 Hz against a ball of hardened steel using different lubricants and normal forces. After 1000 cycles the corresponding wear tracks were characterized by optical and scanning electron microscopy. For specific conditions, the wear was strongly reduced and the laser-generated nano-structures endured the tribological treatment. Simultaneously, a significant reduction of the friction coefficient was observed in the laser-irradiated LIPSS-covered areas, indicating the benefit of laser surface structuring for tribological applications. The spatially Gaussian shaped beam used for the laser processing was transformed via beam shaping into a top hat distribution at the surface of the samples for optimization. The tribological performance of the laser-induced nanostructures is discussed on the basis of different physical and chemical mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) addressed in this chapter are monomolecular organic coatings, which allow one to adjust a variety of surface properties of solid materials including bioaffinity and chemical resistance [1–3]. In view of these opportunities, such organic coatings are widely used as ultrathin resists and functional films in micro- and nanofabrication [1–5]. Nonlinear laser processing has evolved as a powerful and versatile means for nanopatterning of SAMs [6, 7]. Generally, laser processing is a maskless and flexible noncontact technique. Also, rapid processing over areas ranging from square centimeters to square decimeters can be carried out on essentially all kinds of support materials at high pressures and in liquids. In recent years femtosecond (fs) lasers have been proven to provide specific perspectives in nonlinear processing and sub-100 nm patterning of organic monolayers [7]. In particular, finely tuned photothermal reactions and multiphoton absorption processes introduce high nonlinearities [8, 9]. In addition, the ultrathin nature of these coatings allows single pulse processing, thus ensuring short processing times [7]. The molecular thickness also ensures well-defined irradiation and burr-free patterning and avoids the formation of bubbles and particles [8, 9]. All these issues represent common problems in ablative fs-laser processing [10, 11]. This chapter reviews recent progress in nonlinear fs-laser processing of organic monolayers, i.e. results from references [7–9, 12–15]. Particular emphasis is placed on prospects of tunable fs-laser sources in resonant laser processing of organic monolayers and the application of such coatings as ultrathin resists and functional platforms for fabrication of protein micro- and nanoarrays [12–15].},

As an example, in the semiconductor industry, structures well below 100 nm are routinely produced. The characterization of such structures is a demanding and very important task. Classical microscopy methods do not allow direct imaging in this regime because of the Abbe diffraction limit. Nevertheless, characterization of sub-wavelength structures in the far-field is possible using interferometric Fourier transform scatterometry (IFTS) combined with numerical simulation in a feedback loop. Here, we show that the resolution of this method can be considerably enhanced by use of additional plasmonic nanoantennae structures which transform scattering near-field information into the optical far-field. These structures were realized using different photofabrication approaches.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Somatic mutations of the PIK3CA gene have been described in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but limited data is available on their biological relevance. This study was performed to characterize PIK3CA-mutated NSCLC clinically and genetically.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Tumor tissue collected consecutively from 1144 NSCLC patients within a molecular screening network between March 2010 and March 2012 was analyzed for PIK3CA mutations using dideoxy-sequencing and next-generation sequencing (NGS). Clinical, pathological, and genetic characteristics of PIK3CA-mutated patients are described and compared with a control group of PIK3CA-wildtype patients.
RESULTS: Among the total cohort of 1144 patients we identified 42 (3.7\%) patients with PIK3CA mutations in exon 9 and exon 20. These mutations were found with a higher frequency in sqamous cell carcinoma (8.9\%) compared to adenocarcinoma (2.9\%, p{\textless}0.001). The most common PIK3CA mutation was exon 9 E545K. The majority of patients (57.1\%) had additional oncogenic driver aberrations. With the exception of EGFR-mutated patients, non of the genetically defined subgroups in this cohort had a significantly better median overall survival. Further, PIK3CA-mutated patients had a significantly higher incidence of malignancy prior to lung cancer (p{\textless}0.001).
CONCLUSION: PIK3CA-mutated NSCLC represents a clinically and genetically heterogeneous subgroup in adenocarcinomas as well as in squamous cell carcinomas with a higher prevalence of these mutations in sqamous cell carcinoma. PIK3CA mutations have no negative impact on survival after surgery or systemic therapy. However, PIK3CA mutated lung cancer frequently develops in patients with prior malignancies.},

All inborn newborns who received gentamicin for the first episode of suspected or proven sepsis were eligible. Newborns received 4 mg/kg gentamicin intravenously 24-hourly, except for those at {\textless}28 weeks of gestation who received gentamicin 36-hourly. Trough levels were taken before the third dose and considered non-toxic if ≤2 μg/mL. Infants were analysed in gestational age subgroups: {\textless}28 weeks, 28-31 weeks, 32-35 weeks, 36-39 weeks and ≥40 weeks. Newborns who received indomethacin co-medication were analysed separately. Nine hundred ninety-three newborns, gestational age range 23(+2)-42(+1) weeks, birth weight range 397-5936 g, were included. The median (interquartile range (IQR)) gentamicin trough level for all newborns was 1.3 μg/mL (0.8-1.7). Ninety per cent of newborns had non-toxic trough levels. The incidence of trough levels {\textgreater}2 μg/mL was between 2.2 and 9.7 \% in all subgroups except for infants born at 28-31 weeks of gestation, where 21.7 \% of trough levels were {\textgreater}2 μg/mL. Indomethacin co-medication significantly increased the median gentamicin trough level in preterm infants at {\textless}32 weeks of gestation.

	abstract = {CONTEXT: Primary macronodular adrenal hyperplasia (PMAH) is a rare cause of Cushing's syndrome, which may present in the context of different familial multitumor syndromes. Heterozygous inactivating germline mutations of armadillo repeat containing 5 (ARMC5) have very recently been described as cause for sporadic PMAH. Whether this genetic condition also causes familial PMAH in association with other neoplasias is unclear.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to delineate the molecular cause in a large family with PMAH and other neoplasias.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Whole-genome sequencing and comprehensive clinical and biochemical phenotyping was performed in members of a PMAH affected family. Nodules derived from adrenal surgery and pancreatic and meningeal tumor tissue were analyzed for accompanying somatic mutations in the identified target genes.
RESULTS: PMAH presenting either as overt or subclinical Cushing's syndrome was accompanied by a heterozygous germline mutation in ARMC5 (p.A110fs*9) located on chromosome 16. Analysis of tumor tissue showed different somatic ARMC5 mutations in adrenal nodules supporting a second hit hypothesis with inactivation of a tumor suppressor gene. A damaging somatic ARMC5 mutation was also found in a concomitant meningioma (p.R502fs) but not in a pancreatic tumor, suggesting biallelic inactivation of ARMC5 as causal also for the intracranial meningioma.
CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis further confirms inherited inactivating ARMC5 mutations as a cause of familial PMAH and suggests an additional role for the development of concomitant intracranial meningiomas.},

	abstract = {Over the last years, massively parallel sequencing has rapidly evolved and has now transitioned into molecular pathology routine laboratories. It is an attractive platform for analysing multiple genes at the same time with very little input material. Therefore, the need for high quality DNA obtained from automated DNA extraction systems has increased, especially to those laboratories which are dealing with formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) material and high sample throughput. This study evaluated five automated FFPE DNA extraction systems as well as five DNA quantification systems using the three most common techniques, UV spectrophotometry, fluorescent dye-based quantification and quantitative PCR, on 26 FFPE tissue samples. Additionally, the effects on downstream applications were analysed to find the most suitable pre-analytical methods for massively parallel sequencing in routine diagnostics. The results revealed that the Maxwell 16 from Promega (Mannheim, Germany) seems to be the superior system for DNA extraction from FFPE material. The extracts had a 1.3-24.6-fold higher DNA concentration in comparison to the other extraction systems, a higher quality and were most suitable for downstream applications. The comparison of the five quantification methods showed intermethod variations but all methods could be used to estimate the right amount for PCR amplification and for massively parallel sequencing. Interestingly, the best results in massively parallel sequencing were obtained with a DNA input of 15 ng determined by the NanoDrop 2000c spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). No difference could be detected in mutation analysis based on the results of the quantification methods. These findings emphasise, that it is particularly important to choose the most reliable and constant DNA extraction system, especially when using small biopsies and low elution volumes, and that all common DNA quantification techniques can be used for downstream applications like massively parallel sequencing.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE STUDY: The Sorin Perceval S (SP) sutureless bioprosthesis was developed as an advancement of conventional biological aortic valve replacement (AVR) with stented bioprostheses, and perhaps also as an alternative to the transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) procedure, especially for high-risk patients. Herein are described the authors' early results with SP valve replacement, compared to AVR with Carpentier-Edwards Perimount (EP) stented valves.
METHODS: Between September 2012 and February 2013, a total of 14 patients was enrolled in a single-center SP study group, and their data were analyzed in a prospective manner. For comparison, 14 patients who received an EP valve replacement during the same period were matched with the SP group, in a retrospective manner. Hemodynamic parameters and clinical outcome were monitored until discharge of the patients in order to analyze the early results of the two groups.
RESULTS: The cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and aortic cross-clamp (ACC) times needed for AVR with SP valves were significantly shorter than with EP valves. The mean CPB time for SP valve replacement without concomitant procedures was 58.4 +/- 11.0 min, compared to 71.8 +/- 11.3 min in the EP group (p = 0.015), while the mean ACC times were 37.3 +/- 6.8 and 49.1 +/- 11.2 min, respectively (p = 0.006). Permanent pacemaker implantation was required in four patients after SP valve replacement, but in only one patient after EP valve replacement (p = 0.326). The mean transprosthetic peak and mean gradients were 24.8 +/- 5.2 mmHg and 13.3 +/- 3.3 mmHg, respectively, in the SP group, and 19.0 +/- 6.5 mmHg and 10.4 +/- 3.0 mmHg, respectively, in the EP group (p = 0.024 and p = 0.087). The mean valve size was 23.8 +/- 1.3 mm and 23.3 +/- 1.5 mm in the SP and EP groups, respectively. The fall in platelet count after SP valve replacement was 180.4 +/- 79.4 x 10(3)/microl on the first postoperative day (POD), and 114.1 +/- 51.2 x 10(3)/microl with a minimum of 42 x 10(3)/microl and a maximum of 230 x 10(3)/microl at the nadir on POD 2.6 +/- 4.0. The mean minimum values at the nadir corresponded to 40\% of the initial preoperative value.
CONCLUSION: The sutureless SP bioprosthesis seems to represent a good alternative to conventional stented bioprostheses, especially in older patients with a high-risk profile, and particularly if concomitant surgical procedures are planned.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Liver ischemia and reperfusion injury is a common source of significant morbidity and mortality following liver transplantation, hemorrhagic shock, or major hepatic surgery. Based on studies showing a critical role for the neuronal guidance receptor neogenin (Neo1) outside the nervous system in mediating tissue adaption during acute inflammation, we hypothesized that Neo1 enhances hepatic ischemia and reperfusion injury.
DESIGN: Animal study.
SETTING: University-based experimental laboratory.
SUBJECTS: Wid-type, neogenin deficient and chimeric mice.
INTERVENTIONS: Neogenin expression was evaluated during inflammatory stimulation in vitro and during ischemia and reperfusion injury in vivo, intravital microscopy performed to study intravascular flow characteristics. The extent of liver injury was evaluated using histology, serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate, and alanine aminotransferase. The functional role of Neo1 during liver IR was evaluated in mice with gene targeted repression of neogenin (Neo1-/-), bone marrow chimeric animals and controls. In addition, functional inhibition of neogenin was performed using antibody injection.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We observed an induction of Neo1 during inflammation in vitro and ischemia and reperfusion in vivo. Intravital microscopy demonstrated a decreased ability of Neo1 leukocytes to attach to endothelial vascular wall during inflammation. Subsequent studies in Neo1 mice showed attenuated serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate, alanine, and proinflammatory cytokines during hepatic ischemia and reperfusion injury. This was associated with improved hepatic histology scores. Studies in chimeric animals demonstrated that the hematopoietic Neo1 expression to be crucial for the observed results. Treatment with an anti-Neo1 antibody resulted in a significant reduction of experimental hepatic ischemia and reperfusion injury, involving attenuated variable of lactate dehydrogenase, alanine, aspartate, and cytokine levels.
CONCLUSIONS: These data provide a unique role for Neo1 in the development of hepatic ischemia and reperfusion injury and identified Neo1 as a potential target to prevent liver dysfunction in the future.},

PLXNC1(-/-) mice with C57BL/6 background demonstrated decreased inflammatory responses during zymosan A (ZyA)-induced peritonitis. Subsequent in vivo studies revealed altered rolling, adhesion, and transmigration properties of PLXNC1(-/-) leukocytes. Blockade of PLXNC1 was associated with attenuated chemotactic transendothelial migration properties in vitro. Studies in chimeric mice revealed that hematopoietic PLXNC1(-/-) animals demonstrated an attenuated inflammatory response. To probe the therapeutic potential of PLXNC1 we treated C57BL/6 WT mice with an anti-PLXNC1 antibody and a PLXNC1 binding peptide. Both of these interventions significantly dampened ZyA-induced peritonitis. These results implicate an important role of PLXNC1 during an acute inflammatory response and indicate PLXNC1 as a potential target for the control of conditions associated with acute inflammation.},

The project is supported by the health insurance companies in Hesse and the Professional Association of Gynaecologists in Hesse. The aim is to offer structured treatment programmes to all women diagnosed with breast cancer in Hesse by creating intersectoral cooperations between coordinating clinics, associated hospitals and gynaecologists in private practice who registered in the DMP programme. Method: Between 1 January 2005 and 30 June 2011, 13 973 women were enrolled in the DMP programme. Results: After data cleansing, survival rates were calculated for a total of 11 214 women. The 5-year overall survival (OS) rate was 86.3 \%; survival rates according to tumour stage on presentation were 92.2 \% (pT1) and 82.3 \% (pT2), respectively. The impact of steroid hormone receptor status on survival (87.8 \% for receptor-positive cancers vs. 78.9 \% for receptor-negative cancers) and of age at first diagnosis on survival (≤ 35 years = 91 \%) were calculated. Conclusion: The project showed that intersectoral cooperation led to significant improvements in the quality of treatment over time, as measured by quality indicators and outcomes after treatment.},

This regulation is linked to retrograde signals that transmit information on the metabolic state of the chloroplast to the nucleus. Transcripts of several APETALA2/ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR transcription factors (AP2/ERF-TFs) were found to respond within 10 min after transfer of low-light-acclimated Arabidopsis thaliana plants to high light. Initiation of this transcriptional response was completed within 1 min after transfer to high light. The fast responses of four AP2/ERF genes, ERF6, RRTF1, ERF104, and ERF105, were entirely deregulated in triose phosphate/phosphate translocator (tpt) mutants. Similarly, activation of MITOGEN-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE6 (MPK6) was upregulated after 1 min in the wild type but not in the tpt mutant. Based on this, together with altered transcript regulation in mpk6 and erf6 mutants, a retrograde signal transmission model is proposed starting with metabolite export through the triose phosphate/phosphate translocator with subsequent MPK6 activation leading to initiation of AP2/ERF-TF gene expression and other downstream gene targets. The results show that operational retrograde signaling in response to high light involves a metabolite-linked pathway in addition to previously described redox and hormonal pathways.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hamartin (TSC1) and tuberin (TSC2), encoded by the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) genes, form a tumor-suppressor heterodimer which is implicated in PI3K-Akt signaling and acts as a functional inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Dysregulation of mTOR has been assigned to carcinogenesis and thus may be involved in cancer development. We have addressed the role of hamartin, phospho-tuberin (p-TSC2) and phospho-mTOR (p-mTOR) in a series of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) samples.
METHODS: We collected 166 NSCLC and SCLC samples for immunohistochemical studies and performed western blot analyses in NSCLC and SCLC cell lines as well as comparative analyses with EGFR phosphorylation and downstream effectors.
RESULTS: In cell lines we found an inverse correlation between hamartin and p-mTOR expression. In surgical specimens cytoplasmic hamartin expression was observed in more than 50\% of adenocarcinoma (AC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) compared to 14\% of SCLC. P-mTOR and p-TSC2 staining was found in a minority of cases.There was a significant correlation between p-EGFR Tyr-1068, p-EGFR Tyr-992 and hamartin, and also between p-mTOR and p-EGFR Tyr-1173 in AC. In SCC an inverse correlation between hamartin and p-EGFR Tyr-992 was detected. Phosphorylation of TSC2 was associated with expression of MAP-Kinase. Hamartin, p-TSC2 and p-mTOR expression was not dependant of the EGFR mutation status. Hamartin expression is associated with poorer survival in SCC and SCLC.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings confirm the inhibitory role of the tuberous sclerosis complex for mTOR activation in lung cancer cell lines. These results reveal hamartin expression in a substantial subset of NSCLC and SCLC specimens, which may be due to EGFR signaling but is not dependant on EGFR mutations. Our data provide evidence for a functional role of the tuberous sclerosis complex in lung cancer.

	abstract = {High light acclimation depends on retrograde control of nuclear gene expression. Retrograde regulation uses multiple signalling pathways and thus exploits signal patterns. To maximally challenge the acclimation system, Arabidopsis thaliana plants were either adapted to 8 (low light (L-light)) or 80 µmol quanta m(-2) s(-1) (normal light (N-light)) and subsequently exposed to a 100- and 10-fold light intensity increase, respectively, to high light (H-light, 800 µmol quanta m(-2) s(-1)), for up to 6 h. Both L → H- and N → H-light plants efficiently regulated CO2 assimilation to a constant level without apparent damage and inhibition. This experimental set-up was scrutinized for time-dependent regulation and efficiency of adjustment. Transcriptome profiles revealed that N-light and L-light plants differentially accumulated 2119 transcripts. After 6 h in H-light, only 205 remained differently regulated between the L → H- and N → H-light plants, indicating efficient regulation allowing the plants to reach a similar transcriptome state. Time-dependent analysis of transcripts as markers for signalling pathways, and of metabolites and hormones as possibly involved transmitters, suggests that oxylipins such as oxophytodienoic acid and jasmonic acid, metabolites and redox cues predominantly control the acclimation response, whereas abscisic acid, salicylic acid and auxins play an insignificant or minor role.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Preterm infants are at risk of circulatory compromise following birth. Functional neonatal echocardiography including superior vena cava (SVC) flow is increasingly used in neonatal medicine, and low SVC flow has been associated with adverse outcome. However, echocardiography is not readily available in many neonatal units and B-type natriuretic peptides (BNPs) may be useful in guiding further cardiovascular assessment. This study investigated the relationship between BNP, N-terminal pro-BNP (NTproBNP) and echocardiographic measurements of systemic blood flow in very preterm infants.
STUDY DESIGN: This is a prospective observational study. Sixty preterm infants {\textless}32 weeks gestational age were included after the treating neonatologist had requested an echocardiogram for suspected cardiovascular compromise. BNP and NTproBNP were sampled just before the echocardiogram. Echocardiographic examination included fractional shortening (FS), SVC flow, left and right ventricular output (LVO and RVO). Statistical analysis included simple linear regression of BNP and NTproBNP with echocardiographic measures and multiple regression including potential confounding variables.
RESULT: Mean (s.d.) gestational age at birth was 27(5) (2(1)) weeks, median (interquartile range, IQR) birth weight was 995 (845 to 1175) grams. Neither BNP nor NTproBNP correlated with SVC flow (BNP 95\% confidence interval (CI) -0.0014 to 0.013, P=0.12; NTproBNP 95\% CI -0.00069 to 0.01, P=0.085); LVO (BNP 95\% CI -0.00078 to 0.0072, P=0.11; NTproBNP 95\% CI -0.0034 to 0.0034, P=0.99); RVO (BNP 95\% CI -0.00066 to 0.0058, P=0.12; NTproBNP 95\% CI -0.0012 to 0.0044, P=0.25); or FS (BNP 95\% CI -0.053 to 0.051, P=0.96; NTproBNP 95\% CI -0.061 to 0.019, P=0.3). Multivariate linear regression did not significantly alter results.
CONCLUSION: In this cohort of very preterm infants, BNP and NTproBNP did not correlate with echocardiographic measurements of systemic blood flow within the first 72 h of life.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The approval of vemurafenib in the US 2011 and in Europe 2012 improved the therapy of not resectable or metastatic melanoma. Patients carrying a substitution of valine to glutamic acid at codon 600 (p.V600E) or a substitution of valine to leucine (p.V600K) in BRAF show complete or partial response. Therefore, the precise identification of the underlying somatic mutations is essential. Herein, we evaluate the sensitivity, specificity and feasibility of six different methods for the detection of BRAF mutations.
METHODS: Samples harboring p.V600E mutations as well as rare mutations in BRAF exon 15 were compared to wildtype samples. DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues by manual micro-dissection and automated extraction. BRAF mutational analysis was carried out by high resolution melting (HRM) analysis, pyrosequencing, allele specific PCR, next generation sequencing (NGS) and immunohistochemistry (IHC). All mutations were independently reassessed by Sanger sequencing. Due to the limited tumor tissue available different numbers of samples were analyzed with each method (82, 72, 60, 72, 49 and 82 respectively).
RESULTS: There was no difference in sensitivity between the HRM analysis and Sanger sequencing (98\%). All mutations down to 6.6\% allele frequency could be detected with 100\% specificity. In contrast, pyrosequencing detected 100\% of the mutations down to 5\% allele frequency but exhibited only 90\% specificity. The allele specific PCR failed to detect 16.3\% of the mutations eligible for therapy with vemurafenib. NGS could analyze 100\% of the cases with 100\% specificity but exhibited 97.5\% sensitivity. IHC showed once cross-reactivity with p.V600R but was a good amendment to HRM.
CONCLUSION: Therefore, at present, a combination of HRM and IHC is recommended to increase sensitivity and specificity for routine diagnostic to fulfill the European requirements concerning vemurafenib therapy of melanoma patients.},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: COMPliance and Arthralgia in Clinical Therapy (COMPACT) was an open-label, multicenter, noninterventional study conducted in Germany. Patients had started adjuvant anastrozole 3-6 months before the study start. The primary end points were arthralgia, compliance, and the relationship between compliance and arthralgia, assessed at specific time points.
RESULTS: Overall, 1916 patients received upfront anastrozole. Mean arthralgia scores were increased from baseline at each visit up to 9 months. Compliance with anastrozole therapy gradually decreased over time from baseline to 9 months (P{\textless}0.001). At 9 months, investigators estimated that {\textgreater}95\% of patients were compliant versus patient reports of {\textless}70\%. There was a significant association between arthralgia mean scores and noncompliance at 6 months (P{\textless}0.0001), 9 months (P{\textless}0.0001), and overall (P{\textless}0.0001). Over time, new events or impairment of existing arthralgias were reported in 14\% (3 months), 11\% (6 months), and 9\% (9 months) of patients.
CONCLUSION: Arthralgia is important in the clinical management of women with early breast cancer and may contribute to noncompliance and clinical outcomes.

	abstract = {Acute pulmonary inflammation during lung injury is initiated by the migration of neutrophils into the alveolar space. The severity of these inflammatory changes within the pulmonary tissue determines the severity of lung injury and ultimately patient outcome. Recent work has demonstrated that the guidance protein Semaphorin 7A propagates the infiltration of neutrophils into an hypoxic tissue site, yet the role of its target receptor Plexin C1 (PLXNC1) during lung injury is to date unknown. We demonstrate here that PLXNC1(+) neutrophils are present within the alveolar space and that PLXNC1 is induced in vitro and in vivo during lung injury. In a model of high-pressure ventilation PLXNC1(-/-) animals show decreased signs of alveolar inflammation and improved survival compared with wild-type controls. Studies employing chimeric animals identified the hematopoietic expression of PLXNC1 to be of crucial importance for the observed results. Functional inhibition of PLXNC1 resulted in improved survival and ameliorated the signs of inflammation within the lung. Furthermore, the injection of a peptide binding to PLXNC1 resulted in improved survival and attenuated pulmonary inflammation. As such we demonstrate here, that previously unknown PLXNC1 holds significant importance for degree of pulmonary inflammation and determines outcome during experimental lung injury.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Biomarkers allowing the characterization of malignancy and therapy response of oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC) or other types of carcinomas are still outstanding. The biochemical suicide molecule endonuclease DNaseX (DNaseI-like 1) has been used to identify the Apo10 protein epitope that marks tumor cells with abnormal apoptosis and proliferation. The transketolase-like protein 1 (TKTL1) represents the enzymatic basis for an anaerobic glucose metabolism even in the presence of oxygen (aerobic glycolysis/Warburg effect), which is concomitant with a more malignant phenotype due to invasive growth/metastasis and resistance to radical and apoptosis inducing therapies.
METHODS: Expression of Apo10 and TKTL1 was analysed retrospectively in OSCC specimen (n = 161) by immunohistochemistry. Both markers represent independent markers for poor survival. Furthermore Apo10 and TKTL1 have been used prospectively for epitope detection in monocytes (EDIM)-blood test in patients with OSCC (n = 50), breast cancer (n = 48), prostate cancer (n = 115), and blood donors/controls (n = 74).
RESULTS: Positive Apo10 and TKTL1 expression were associated with recurrence of the tumor. Multivariate analysis demonstrated Apo10 and TKTL1 expression as an independent prognostic factor for reduced tumor-specific survival. Apo10+/TKTL1+ subgroup showed the worst disease-free survival rate in OSCC.EDIM-Apo10 and EDIM-TKTL1 blood tests allowed a sensitive and specific detection of patients with OSCC, breast cancer and prostate cancer before surgery and in after care. A combined score of Apo10+/TKTL1+ led to a sensitivity of 95.8\% and a specificity of 97.3\% for the detection of carcinomas independent of the tumor entity.
CONCLUSIONS: The combined detection of two independent fundamental biophysical processes by the two biomarkers Apo10 and TKTL1 allows a sensitive and specific detection of neoplasia in a noninvasive and cost-effective way. Further prospective trials are warranted to validate this new concept for the diagnosis of neoplasia and tumor recurrence.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Rare diseases pose many research challenges specific to their scarcity. Advances in potential therapies have made it more important than ever to be able to adequately identify not only patients with particular genotypes (via patient registries) but also the medical professionals who provide care for them at particular specialist centres of expertise and who may be competent to participate in trials. Work within the neuromuscular field provides an example of how this may be achieved.
METHODS: This paper describes the development of the TREAT-NMD Care and Trial Site Registry (CTSR), an initiative of an EU-funded Network of Excellence, and its utility in providing an infrastructure for clinical trial feasibility, recruitment, and other studies.
RESULTS: 285 CTSR-registered centres, reporting 35,495 neuromuscular patients, are described alongside an analysis of their provision for DMD. Site characteristics vary by country: the average number of DMD patients seen per site in the United States (96) is more than in Germany (25), and paediatric/adult breakdown is also markedly distinct. Over 70\% of sites have previous trial experience, with a majority including a Clinical Trials Unit. Most sites also have MLPA diagnostic capability and access to a range of medical specialists. However, in the three countries reporting most sites (US, the UK and Germany), few had access to all core DMD specialists internally. Over 60\% of sites did not report any form of transition arrangement.
CONCLUSIONS: Registries of care and trial sites have significant utility for research into rare conditions such as neuromuscular diseases, demonstrated by the significant engagement by industry and other researchers with the CTSR. We suggest that this approach may be applicable to other fields needing to identify centres of expertise with the potential to carry out clinical research and engage in clinical trials. Such registries also lend themselves to the developing context of European Reference Networks (ERNs), which seek to build networks of centres of expertise which fit specific criteria, and which may themselves aid the sustainability of such registries. This is particularly the case given the utility of registries such as the CTSR in enabling networks of best-practice care centres.},

	abstract = {The UNC5 receptor family are chemorepulsive neuronal guidance receptors with additional functions outside the central nervous system. Previous studies have implicated that the UNC5B receptor influences the migration of leukocytes into sites of tissue inflammation. Given that this process is a critical step during the pathophysiology of myocardial ischemia followed by reperfusion (IR) we investigated the role of UNC5B during myocardial IR. In initial in-vitro experiments, the functional inhibition of UNC5B resulted in a significant reduction of chemotactic migration of neutrophils. In-vivo, using a model of acute myocardial ischemia in UNC5B(+/-) and wild type (WT) animals, we found a significant reduction of infarct sizes in UNC5B(+/-) animals. This was associated with significantly reduced levels of troponin-I and IL-6 in UNC5B(+/-) mice. The repression of UNC5B using siRNA and the functional inhibition of UNC5B significantly dampened the extent of myocardial IR injury. Following depletion of neutrophils, we were not able to observe any further reduction in infarct size through functional inhibition of UNC5B in WT and UNC5B(+/-) mice. In summary our studies demonstrate an important role for UNC5B during myocardial IR injury, and that UNC5B might be a potential therapeutic target to control reperfusion injury in the future.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is increasingly used as first-line management of respiratory distress syndrome in preterm infants to avoid the lung-damaging effects of mechanical ventilation (MV). We hypothesised that even a short period of MV following surfactant treatment would increase the rate of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD).
METHODS: Retrospective study including preterm infants {\textless}30 weeks gestational age over a six-year period if they required surfactant followed by MV not longer than 24 h (SURF\&MV group) or if managed exclusively with NIV (NIV group). Baseline and morbidity variables such as gestation, birth weight, sex, place of birth, antenatal steroids, sepsis, pneumothorax, intraventricular haemorrhage, necrotising enterocolitis, and patent ductus arteriosus were analysed in a multivariate model for potential confounding.
RESULTS: 289 infants were included: 150 in the NIV group and 139 in the SURF\&MV group. Seventeen infants in the NIV group and 23 in the SURF\&MV group developed BPD (odds ratio: 1.55; 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.79-3.05; p = 0.202). After adjusting for potential confounders, the odds ratio was 1.09 for the SURF\&MV group to develop BPD (95\% CI: 0.52-2.28; p = 0.812).
CONCLUSION: The rate of BPD did not differ between infants managed with NIV or with surfactant administration followed by ≤24 h of MV after adjusting for confounding factors.},

We conducted a proof-of-concept randomised controlled pilot study to assess the feasibility of oral sildenafil treatment in extremely preterm infants with evolving bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
METHODS: Preterm infants {\textless}28 weeks gestational age were eligible if they were mechanically ventilated on day 7 of life. Infants were randomised to a 4-weeks course of either oral sildenafil (3 mg/kg/day) or placebo solution. Pre-discharge cardiorespiratory outcomes and medication side effects were collected.
RESULTS: Twenty infants were randomised, 10 received sildenafil (mean gestational age 24 + 5 weeks (SD 4.9 days), mean weight 692 g (SD 98)) and 10 received placebo (mean gestational age 24 + 5 weeks (SD 6.5 days), mean weight 668 g (SD 147)). One infant in the sildenafil group did not receive treatment because of an early pneumoperitoneum. Two infants did not complete the study (transferred out). Of the remaining seven treated infants, three died (two from respiratory-related causes). One infant in the control group died from a non-respiratory cause. Sildenafil did not reduce length of invasive (median 688 versus 227 h) or non-invasive ventilation (median 1609 versus 1416 h). More infants in the sildenafil group required postnatal steroid treatment. One infant developed hypotension following sildenafil administration and was excluded after three doses.
CONCLUSIONS: In this pilot study, oral sildenafil treatment did not improve any short-term respiratory outcomes in extremely preterm infants.},

METHODS: Pharyngeal pressure measurements were taken from stable premature infants receiving HHHFNC for respiratory support. Flow rates of 2-8 L/min were studied.
RESULTS: Nine infants had pharyngeal pressure measurements recorded with both HHHFNC devices at flow rates of 2-8 L/min. There was no difference in pharyngeal pressures recorded between devices at flow rates of 2-6 L/min; measured pressure was linearly associated with flow (R(2) = 0.9). At flow rates of 7 L/min, Vapotherm delivered a mean (standard deviation) pharyngeal pressure of 4.7 (2.2) cmH2 O compared with 4.23 (2.2) cmH2 O by the Fisher \& Paykel device (P = 0.04). At a flow of 8 L/min, the mean pharyngeal pressure via Vapotherm was 4.9 (2.2) cmH2 O compared with 4.1 (2.3) cmH2 O with the Fisher \& Paykel device (P = 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Both HHHFNC delivered similar pharyngeal pressures at flow rates of 2-6 L/min. The pressure limiter valve of the Fisher \& Paykel device attenuated the pharyngeal pressures at flows of 7 and 8 L/min. Vapotherm trended towards higher delivered pharyngeal pressure at flow rates 7 and 8 L/min, but the clinical significance of the difference remains unclear.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Almost nothing is known about the medical aspects of runners doing a transcontinental ultramarathon over several weeks. The results of differentiated measurements of changes in body composition during the Transeurope Footrace 2009 using a mobile whole body magnetic resonance (MR) imager are presented and the proposed influence of visceral and somatic adipose and lean tissue distribution on performance tested.
METHODS: 22 participants were randomly selected for the repeated MR measurements (intervals: 800 km) with a 1.5 Tesla MR scanner mounted on a mobile unit during the 64-stage 4,486 km ultramarathon. A standardized and validated MRI protocol was used: T1 weighted turbo spin echo sequence, echo time 12 ms, repetition time 490 ms, slice thickness 10 mm, slice distance 10 mm (breath holding examinations). For topographic tissue segmentation and mapping a modified fuzzy c-means algorithm was used. A semi-automatic post-processing of whole body MRI data sets allows reliable analysis of the following body tissue compartments: Total body volume (TV), total somatic (TSV) and total visceral volume (TVV), total adipose (TAT) and total lean tissue (TLT), somatic (SLT) and visceral lean tissue (VLT), somatic (SAT) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and somatic adipose soft tissue (SAST). Specific volume changes were tested on significance. Tests on difference and relationship regarding prerace and race performance and non-finishing were done using statistical software SPSS.
RESULTS: Total, somatic and visceral volumes showed a significant decrease throughout the race. Adipose tissue showed a significant decrease compared to the start at all measurement times for TAT, SAST and VAT. Lean adipose tissues decreased until the end of the race, but not significantly. The mean relative volume changes of the different tissue compartments at the last measurement compared to the start were: TV -9.5\% (SE 1.5\%), TSV -9.4\% (SE 1.5\%), TVV -10.0\% (SE 1.4\%), TAT -41.3\% (SE 2.3\%), SAST -48.7\% (SE 2.8\%), VAT -64.5\% (SE 4.6\%), intraabdominal adipose tissue (IAAT) -67.3\% (SE 4.3\%), mediastinal adopose tissue (MAT) -41.5\% (SE 7.1\%), TLT -1.2\% (SE 1.0\%), SLT -1.4\% (SE 1.1\%). Before the start and during the early phase of the Transeurope Footrace 2009, the non-finisher group had a significantly higher percentage volume of TVV, TAT, SAST and VAT compared to the finisher group. VAT correlates significantly with prerace training volume and intensity one year before the race and with 50 km- and 24 hour-race records. Neither prerace body composition nor specific tissue compartment volume changes showed a significant relationship to performance in the last two thirds of the Transeurope Footrace 2009.
CONCLUSIONS: With this mobile MRI field study the complex changes in body composition during a multistage ultramarathon could be demonstrated in detail in a new and differentiated way. Participants lost more than half of their adipose tissue. Even lean tissue volume (mainly skeletal muscle tissue) decreased due to the unpreventable chronic negative energy balance during the race. VAT has the fastest and highest decrease compared to SAST and lean tissue compartments during the race. It seems to be the most sensitive morphometric parameter regarding the risk of non-finishing a transcontinental footrace and shows a direct relationship to prerace-performance. However, body volume or body mass and, therefore, fat volume has no correlation with total race performances of ultra-athletes finishing a 4,500 km multistage race.},

	abstract = {AIM: To study the impact on newborn behavioural states and accuracy of three infrared thermometers compared with digital axillary thermometer measurements in very low birth weight infants.
METHODS: Single-centre prospective observational study. Preterm infants born {\textless}1500-g birth weight were eligible. Infants were observed for pre-measurement behaviour state using a five-point neonatal behaviour observation tool. One infrared temperature was taken from each of the devices, followed by an axillary measurement. Further behaviour-state observations were recorded following infrared and axillary measurements.
RESULTS: One hundred measurements were collected from each infrared device among a cohort of 42 very low birth weight infants. Only one infrared device showed satisfactory agreement with bias -0.071 (95\% limits of agreement -0.68 to 0.54). The other two devices demonstrated poor agreement: bias -1.34; 95\% limits of agreement -2.62 to -0.5 and bias -0.56; 95\% limits of agreement -1.38 to 0.25. Neonatal behavioural scores showed only minimal changes when infrared measurements were performed but increased significantly following axillary measurements. The difference between the two modalities was statistically significant with a mean increase of 1.44 points following axillary measurements (95\% confidence interval 1.21 to 1.67, P {\textless} 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Temperature measurements taken with infrared thermometers demonstrated less disruption to preterm infants' behavioural state, however accuracy of devices varied.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim of our work was to develop and validate a reliable LC-MS/MS-based measurement procedure for the quantification of vancomycin in serum, to be applied in the context of efforts to standardize and harmonize therapeutic drug monitoring of this compound using routine assays.
METHODS: Sample preparation was based on protein precipitation followed by ultrafiltration. In order to minimize differential modulation of ionization by matrix constituents extended chromatographic separation was applied leading to a retention time of 9.8 min for the analyte. Measurement was done by HPLC-ESI-MS/MS. For internal standardization the derivative vancomycin-glycin (ISTD) prepared by chemical synthesis was used, HPLC conditions ensured coelution of ISTD with the analyte.
RESULTS: In a bi-center validation total CVs of {\textless}4\% were observed for quality control material ranging from 5.3 mg/L to 79.4 mg/L; accuracy was ±4\%. No relevant ion suppression was observed. Comparative measurement of aliquots from 70 samples at the two validation sites demonstrated close agreement.
CONCLUSIONS: Employing a closely related homologue molecule for internal standardization and the use of MS/MS following highly efficient sample pre-fractionation by HPLC, the method described here can be considered to offer the highest level of analytical reliability realized so far for the quantification of vancomycin in human serum. Thus, the method is suitable to be used in a comprehensive reference measurement system for vancomycin.},

	abstract = {Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), the phenotypical change of cells from an epithelial to a mesenchymal type, is thought to be a key event in invasion and metastasis of adenocarcinomas. These changes involve loss of keratin expression as well as loss of cell polarity and adhesion. We here aimed to determine whether the loss of keratin expression itself drives increased invasion and metastasis in adenocarcinomas and whether keratin loss leads to the phenotypic changes associated with EMT. Therefore, we employed a recently described murine model in which conditional deletion of the Keratin cluster II by Cre-recombinase leads to the loss of the entire keratinmultiprotein family. These mice were crossed into a newly generated Cre-recombinase inducible KRAS-driven murine lung cancer model to examine the effect of keratin loss on morphology, invasion and metastasis as well as expression of EMT related genes in the resulting tumors. We here clearly show that loss of a functional keratin cytoskeleton did not significantly alter tumor morphology or biology in terms of invasion, metastasis, proliferation or tumor burden and did not lead to induction of EMT. Further, tumor cells did not induce synchronously expression of vimentin, which is often seen in EMT, to compensate for keratin loss. In summary, our data suggest that changes in cell shape and migration that underlie EMT are dependent on changes in signaling pathways that cause secondary changes in keratin expression and organization. Thus, we conclude that loss of the keratin cytoskeleton per se is not sufficient to causally drive EMT in this tumor model.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Excessive ambient noise levels have been identified as a potential risk factor for adverse outcome in very preterm infants. Noise level measurements for continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) devices demonstrated that these constantly exceed current recommendations. The use of high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) as an alternative non-invasive ventilation modality has become more popular in recent years in neonatal care.
OBJECTIVE: To study noise levels of two HFNC devices commonly used in newborns. As a comparison, noise levels of a continuous flow CPAP device were also studied.
METHODS: In-vitro study. The noise levels of two contemporary HFNC devices (Fisher \& Paykel NHF™ and Vapotherm Precision Flow®) and one CPAP device (Dräger Babylog® 8000 plus) were measured in the oral cavity of a newborn manikin in an incubator in a quiet environment. HFNC flows of 4-8 l/min and CPAP pressures of 4-8 cm H2O were applied. The CPAP flow was set at 8 l/min as per unit practice.
RESULTS: Vapotherm HFNC generated the highest noise levels, measuring 81.2-91.4 dB(A) with increasing flow. Fisher \& Paykel HFNC noise levels were between 78.8 and 81.2 dB(A). The CPAP device generated the lowest noise levels between 73.9 and 77.4 dB(A).
CONCLUSIONS: Both HFNC devices generated higher noise levels than the CPAP device. All noise levels were far above current recommendations of the American Academy of Pediatrics. In light of the long duration of non-invasive respiratory support of very preterm infants, less noisy devices are required to prevent the potentially adverse effects of continuing excessive noise exposure in the neonatal intensive care unit.},

	abstract = {The molecular mechanisms that control the balance between antiangiogenic and proangiogenic factors and initiate the angiogenic switch in tumors remain poorly defined. By combining chemical genetics with multimodal imaging, we have identified an autocrine feed-forward loop in tumor cells in which tumor-derived VEGF stimulates VEGF production via VEGFR2-dependent activation of mTOR, substantially amplifying the initial proangiogenic signal. Disruption of this feed-forward loop by chemical perturbation or knockdown of VEGFR2 in tumor cells dramatically inhibited production of VEGF in vitro and in vivo. This disruption was sufficient to prevent tumor growth in vivo. In patients with lung cancer, we found that this VEGF:VEGFR2 feed-forward loop was active, as the level of VEGF/VEGFR2 binding in tumor cells was highly correlated to tumor angiogenesis. We further demonstrated that inhibition of tumor cell VEGFR2 induces feedback activation of the IRS/MAPK signaling cascade. Most strikingly, combined pharmacological inhibition of VEGFR2 (ZD6474) and MEK (PD0325901) in tumor cells resulted in dramatic tumor shrinkage, whereas monotherapy only modestly slowed tumor growth. Thus, a tumor cell-autonomous VEGF:VEGFR2 feed-forward loop provides signal amplification required for the establishment of fully angiogenic tumors in lung cancer. Interrupting this feed-forward loop switches tumor cells from an angiogenic to a proliferative phenotype that sensitizes tumor cells to MAPK inhibition.},

DESIGN AND METHODS: A commercially available kit including a protein denaturation reagent and functionalized magnetic particles together with a magnetic separator device was tested by addressing the quantification of amiodarone in serum as an exemplary analyte by LC-MS/MS with on-line SPE. A standard method validation protocol was applied.
RESULTS: The sample preparation protocol was found to be convenient, straightforward and robust. Validation data characterized the entire analytical method - combining particle-based protein depletion and two-dimensional chromatography - as compatible with the analytical needs regarding selectivity, accuracy (102-106\%), linearity (r(2)≥0.99), reproducibility (CV{\textless}7\%), and control of ion suppression.
CONCLUSIONS: Since this novel approach of sample preparation does neither require centrifugation nor the technically demanding application of positive or negative pressure, as in conventional solid phase extraction protocols, it seems highly attractive for developing fully automatized preparation systems for LC-MS/MS analyzers.},

Given the fact that ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) of the liver is a common source of liver dysfunction and the role of UNC5B during an acute inflammatory response we investigated the role of UNC5B on acute hepatic IRI. We report here that UNC5B(+/-) mice display reduced hepatic IRI and neutrophil (PMN) infiltration compared to WT controls. This correlated with serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate- (AST) and alanine- (ALT) aminotransferase, the presence of PMN within ischemic hepatic tissue, and serum levels of inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, injection of an anti-UNC5B antibody resulted in a significant reduction of hepatic IR injury. This was associated with reduced parameters of liver injury (LDH, ALT, AST) and accumulation of PMN within the injured hepatic tissue. In conclusion our studies demonstrate a significant role for UNC5B in the development of hepatic IRI and identified UNC5B as a potential drug target to prevent liver dysfunction in the future.},

Unfortunately, the majority of NSCLC expressing wild type EGFR is primarily resistant to EGFR-TKI treatment. Here, we show that the proliferation of the gefitinib-resistant NSCLC cell lines H460 and A549 is reduced by the small molecule SecinH3 which indirectly attenuates EGFR activation by inhibition of cytohesins, a class of recently discovered cytoplasmic EGFR activators. SecinH3 and gefitinib showed a synergistic antiproliferative effect, which correlated with a profound inhibition of Akt activation and survivin expression. Treating mice bearing H460 xenografts with SecinH3 showed the antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic effect of SecinH3 in vivo.

In adults, sildenafil treatment has been associated with several ophthalmological adverse effects, including nonarteritic ischaemic optic neuropathy. We reviewed the effect of sildenafil on retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in very preterm infants.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case-control study. Infants born {\textless}30 weeks gestation who had received sildenafil during their hospitalisation were included. A control group matched for gestation, birth weight, gender, and place of birth was identified from the departmental database. For every sildenafil case, three matched controls were studied. Baseline data, sildenafil therapy data, results of eye examinations and respiratory data were analysed.
RESULT: 17 infants received sildenafil between 2004 and 2010. The median duration of sildenafil treatment was 52 days. Baseline characteristics were similar between groups. The odds ratio for an increase in ROP stage in the group treated with sildenafil was 1.35 (95\% confidence interval 0.39-4.62, P-value 0.63). One infant in each group required laser treatment.
CONCLUSION: Sildenafil treatment did not affect ROP progression or increase the need for laser treatment in this cohort.},

However, the role of mutated ALK in tumorigenesis remains elusive. We demonstrate that targeted expression of the most frequent and aggressive variant, ALK(F1174L), is tumorigenic in mice. Tumors resembled human neuroblastomas in morphology, metastasis pattern, gene expression, and the presence of neurosecretory vesicles as well as synaptic structures. This ALK-driven neuroblastoma mouse model precisely recapitulated the genetic spectrum of the disease. Chromosomal aberrations were syntenic to those in human neuroblastoma, including 17q gain and MYCN oncogene amplification. Targeted ALK(F1174L) and MYCN coexpression revealed a strong synergism in inducing neuroblastoma with minimal chromosomal aberrations, suggesting that fewer secondary hits are required for tumor induction if both oncoproteins are targeted. Treatment of ALK(F1174L) transgenic mice with the ALK inhibitor TAE-684 induced complete tumor regression, indicating that tumor cells were addicted to ALK(F1174L) activity. We conclude that an activating mutation within the ALK kinase domain is sufficient to induce neuroblastoma development, and ALK inhibitors show promise for treating human neuroblastomas harboring ALK mutations.},

Here, we show, with a newly established conditional in vivo knockdown model, that LSD1 represents a central regulator of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. LSD1 knockdown (LSD1-kd) expanded progenitor numbers by enhancing their proliferative behavior. LSD1-kd led to an extensive expansion of granulomonocytic, erythroid and megakaryocytic progenitors. In contrast, terminal granulopoiesis, erythropoiesis and platelet production were severely inhibited. The only exception was monopoiesis, which was promoted by LSD1 deficiency. Importantly, we showed that peripheral blood granulocytopenia, monocytosis, anemia and thrombocytopenia were reversible after LSD1-kd termination. Extramedullary splenic hematopoiesis contributed to the phenotypic reversion, and progenitor populations remained expanded. LSD1-kd was associated with the upregulation of key hematopoietic genes, including Gfi1b, Hoxa9 and Meis1, which are known regulators of the HSC/progenitor compartment. We also demonstrated that LSD1-kd abrogated Gfi1b-negative autoregulation by crossing LSD1-kd with Gfi1b:GFP mice. Taken together, our findings distinguish LSD1 as a critical regulator of hematopoiesis and point to severe, but reversible, side effects of a LSD1-targeted therapy.},

	abstract = {AIM: To study the effects of a supervised exercise program on serum gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), glycemic control and cardiovascular risk factors in pre-diabetic patients with isolated impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and those with IFG plus impaired glucose tolerance (IGT).
METHODS: Out of 60 pre-diabetic patients (30 with isolated IFG and 30 with IFG + IGT) 24 were randomly assigned to the supervised exercise program (1 h twice a week) and 36 only obtained counselling on the risk of diabetes and its prevention. Patients have been followed over a 12-month period.
RESULTS: The main findings were that patients with IFG + IGT had increased GGT levels at baseline (49.2±27.4 U/L) compared to subjects with isolated IFG (28.1±21.9 U/L) (p{\textless}0.01), and that GGT levels improved only after the supervised exercise intervention within the IFG + IGT subjects ( - 17.7±19.6 U/L). Similarly, baseline triglyceride levels were also higher in IFG + IGT patients (p{\textless}0.001) and there was a decrease through exercise intervention in these patients only (p{\textless}0.05).
CONCLUSION: GGT is an unspecific marker of oxidative stress and both high plasma glucose and triglycerides levels may produce oxidative stress. Thus, patients with IFG + IGT seem to have higher levels of oxidative stress than those with isolated IFG. Based on the known association between GGT levels and cardiovascular risk factors, IFG + IGT patients may be at higher risk for the development of cardiovascular diseases. The specific effect of regular exercise on GGT in pre-diabetic patients may contribute to the understanding of the preventive effects related to exercise.},

We studied the diagnostic value of a single measurement of SVC flow within the first 24 h of life in very preterm infants and its association with occurrence or extension of IVH in a setting of limited availability of neonatal echocardiography. Preterm infants who were born at less than 30 weeks gestation and who had an echocardiogram within 24 h after birth were eligible. Baseline, clinical and ultrasound data were collected. A total of 165 preterm infants were included. Low SVC flow ({\textless}41 ml/kg/min) occurred in six infants and was associated with severe IVH and extension of IVH, although this was not significant after adjusting for confounders. The only independently associated variable with low SVC flow was admission temperature (odds ratio 0.27, p = 0.001). A review of SVC flow values shows that these are higher now than initially reported. This study does not show an association of low SVC flow and severe IVH or extension of IVH after adjusting for confounders as a single measurement of SVC flow did not add any diagnostic value in this cohort. Thus, the exact role of SVC flow measurements in the circulatory assessment of preterm infants remains to be elucidated.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Signals reflecting the metabolic and circulatory status of an injured central nervous system are normally corrupted systematically. The patient is part of a therapeutic control-loop and the signals acquired are rather determined by the quality of control (stationarity of signals) than by the underlying pathological process.
METHODS: To verify the control-loop hypothesis, neuromonitoring data from 12 randomly selected severely head injured patients (initial GCS ≤ 8, 7 men, 5 women) were analysed for circulatory (blood pressure, intracranial pressure [ICP], cerebral perfusion pressure [CPP]) and metabolic (arterial blood gases, jugular bulb oxygenation [SjvO(2)], brain tissue oxygen partial pressure [ptiO(2)]) variables (n = 10). A total of 120 time series of generally not equidistant sample intervals were assessed for stationarity by Wallis \& Moore's runs test.
RESULTS: Non-stationarity could only be proven in 23 time series, i.e. the control-loop hypothesis was violated. Trends were mainly found in CPP (n = 5) and ICP (n = 4). The remaining cases spread out on all but one (temperature) signal. Nine patients showed at least one time series with a trend. One patient had clear trends in five out of ten variables that focused on SjvO(2), ptiO(2), ICP and CPP.
CONCLUSIONS: Absence of stationarity in about 20\% of time series is credited to an effective therapeutic control-loop. For analytical purposes, however, the benefit seems to be overestimated. Consequently, neuromonitoring should be considered the analysis of short-term disturbances that are intentionally compensated for by a short response time. Information content is thus reduced even if the number of sensor devices increases.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Transforming intracranial pressure (ICP) into frequency domain commenced in the early 1980s, arriving at the conclusion that cerebrospinal dynamics were mapped by ICP spectral composition. Classical analysis tools were not suitable for handling intrinsic signal non-stationarity. To overcome inherent obstacles we introduce a novel approach based upon wavelets.
METHODS: During routine diagnostic volume pressure testing epidural ICP was acquired in 118 patients with suspected cerebrospinal fluid circulatory disorders. Pressure was digitised and conditioned to separate low frequent signal components ({\textless}heart rate). ICP fluctuations were computed by subtraction of original and low frequent ICP constituents. Subsequently, multiresolution analysis was performed on fluctuations by discrete Haar wavelet transform and coefficients displayed in dyadic fashion (scalogram).
RESULTS: Decomposition of ICP fluctuations led to typical patterns in the scalogram. Episodes of pathological wave activity and artificial ICP changes were topographically detectable in the time frequency plane.
CONCLUSIONS: The wavelet approach is a simple yet powerful signal processing method to estimate both static and dynamic properties of ICP in various clinical scenarios. It therefore outclasses classical spectral transforms that are limited to analysing real-world data. Haar wavelets are fast and robust. Their disadvantages seem not to counterbalance the advantages in this biomedical application.},

We report here that neogenin is abundantly expressed outside the nervous system and that animals with endogenous repression of neogenin (Neo1(-/-)) demonstrate attenuated changes of acute inflammation. Studies using functional inhibition of neogenin resulted in a significant attenuation of inflammatory peritonitis. In studies employing bone marrow chimeric animals we found the hematopoietic presence of Neo1(-/-) to be responsible for the attenuated inflammatory response. Taken together our studies suggest that the guidance receptor neogenin holds crucial importance for the propagation of an acute inflammatory response and further define mechanisms shared between the nervous and the immune system.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Blood pressure (BP) monitoring is an essential procedure in intensive care. There is controversy about the reliability of non-invasive BP measurements in very preterm infants. This prospective trial compared non-invasive BP monitoring with BP monitoring via an umbilical arterial catheter (UAC) in this population.
METHODS: Preterm infants born at less than 32 weeks gestation requiring a UAC for clinical management were eligible. Enrolled infants had up to three BP measurements on the right arm (RA) and right leg (RL) when in a resting state. UAC-BP measurements were noted immediately after the non-invasive BP was displayed on the monitor. Measurements were analysed in subgroups according to birth weight: no greater than 750 g, 751-1,000 g, above 1,000 g. Statistical analysis reports median, range, and Bland-Altman analysis.
RESULTS: Sixty infants were included. Median (range) gestational age was 26.4 weeks (23.6, 31.2); birth weight 924 g (581, 1,518). A total of 1,865 measurements were performed (RA: 935, RL: 930). Mean difference (95\% limits of agreement) for infants no greater than 750 g: RA 2.53 mmHg (-11.18, 16.24), RL -0.804 mmHg (-12.65, 11.04); for infants 751-1,000 g: RA 3.535 mmHg (-9.6, 16.7), RL -1.239 mmHg (-13.14, 10.66); for infants above 1,000 g: RA -1.65 mmHg (-13.47, 10.17), RL -4.101 mmHg (-14.17, 5.96).
CONCLUSIONS: Although the average differences between invasive and non-invasive BP measurements are acceptable, the range of under- and overestimation of non-invasive BP measurements is large and not consistent, making reliance on non-invasive modalities to guide circulatory management problematic. If arterial BP monitoring is not available, our results suggest measuring non-invasive BP on the leg in preterm infants with a birth weight no greater than 1,000 g.},

Given the clinical importance of hepatic IR injury we pursued the role of VASP during hepatic ischemia followed by reperfusion. We report here that VASP(-/-) animals demonstrate reduced hepatic IR injury compared to wildtype (WT) controls. This correlated with serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate (AST) and alanine (ALT) aminotransferase and the presence of PNCs within ischemic hepatic tissue and could be confirmed using repression of VASP through siRNA. In studies employing bone marrow chimeric mice we identified hematopoietic VASP to be of crucial importance for the extent of hepatic injury. Phosphorylation of VASP on Ser(153) through Prostaglandin E1 or on Ser(235) through atrial natriuretic peptide resulted in a significant reduction of hepatic IR injury. This was associated with a reduced presence of PNCs in ischemic hepatic tissue.

Recent work has demonstrated that neuronal guidance proteins are involved into the orchestration of leukocyte migration. Neogenin is a crucial guidance receptor for axonal migration, yet its role during leukocyte migration and acute inflammation is to date unknown. Here, we report that neogenin influences neutrophil migration across endothelial HMEC-1 and alveolar A549 monolayers in vitro. In vivo, Neo1(-/-) mice demonstrated 59\% reduced cell count, 41\% reduced TNF-α, and 76\% reduced IL-6 levels within the alveolar space during lung injury. In studies employing chimeric animals, the presence of Neo1(-/-) bone marrow was associated with a 42\% reduction of cell count and reduced inflammatory changes within pulmonary tissue during lung injury. The functional inhibition of neogenin through antibody injection confirmed these results and the role of neogenin for the inflammatory changes within the alveolar space.

DATA SOURCES: The following databases were searched from inception to February 2011: Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE and CINAHL Plus.
STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: The search was limited to human studies published in the English language. Titles of all articles were screened for relevance. Abstracts of relevant articles were scrutinized to confirm relevance before obtaining full text.
DATA SYNTHESIS: Selected articles were read by 2 authors and the accuracy of the data extracted was confirmed.
RESULTS: Thirty-three articles were included in the final review. Small sample size, missing data, inadequate control for confounding factors, and poor documentation of dosage range were common limitations of the studies reviewed. The use of inhaled corticosteroids, cromolyns, and long-acting β(2) agonists during pregnancy was not associated with any particular adverse event, although the fluticasone/salmeterol combination has been associated with poor outcomes in postmarketing studies. Congenital malformations have been reported with leukotriene receptor antagonist exposure during pregnancy, but those women also had exposure to other medications, including oral corticosteroids.
CONCLUSIONS: Some negative outcomes of preventive asthma medications have been reported, although their direct link with medication use is inconclusive. Selection of preventive medications for asthma management during pregnancy should be based on an assessment of the risks and benefits of medication use versus the risks of poorly controlled asthma.},

A central cytoskeletal protein involved into this is vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP). However, the functional role of endothelial VASP during hypoxia has not been thoroughly elucidated. We determined endothelial VASP expression through real-time PCR (Rt-PCR), immunhistochemistry, and Western blot analysis during hypoxia. VASP promoter studies were performed using a PGL3 firefly luciferase containing plasmid. Following approval by the local authorities, VASP ( -/- ) mice and littermate controls were subjected to normobaric hypoxia (8\% O(2), 92\% N(2)) after intravenous injection of Evans blue dye. In in vitro studies, we found significant VASP repression in human microvascular and human umbilical vein endothelial cells through Rt-PCR, immunhistochemistry, and Western blot analysis. The VASP promoter construct demonstrated significant repression in response to hypoxia, which was abolished when the binding of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha was excluded. Exposure of wild-type (WT) and VASP ( -/- ) animals to normobaric hypoxia for 4 h resulted in an increase in Evans blue tissue extravasation that was significantly increased in VASP ( -/- ) animals compared to WT controls. In summary, we demonstrate here that endothelial VASP holds significant importance for endothelial barrier properties during hypoxia.},

	doi = {10.1186/cc9301},
	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Acute lung injury (ALI) is an inflammatory disorder of pulmonary or extrapulmonary origin. We have previously demonstrated that netrin-1 dampens murine ALI, and in an attempt to advance this finding into future clinical practice we evaluated whether netrin-1 would reduce alveolar inflammation during porcine ALI.
METHODS: This was a controlled in vivo experimental study in pigs. We induced ALI through lipoploysaccharide (LPS) infusion (50 μg/kg) for 2 hours. Following this, we exposed animals to either vehicle, intravenous netrin-1 (netrin-1 i.v.) or inhaled netrin-1 (netrin-1 inh.). Serum samples and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were obtained to determine levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1β, interleukin-6 and interleukin-8 at baseline and 6 hours following treatment. Myeloperoxidase activity (MPO) and protein levels were determined in the BAL, and tissue samples were obtained for histological evaluation. Finally, animals were scanned with spiral CT.
RESULTS: Following LPS infusion, animals developed acute pulmonary injury. Serum levels of TNF-α and IL-6 were significantly reduced in the netrin-1 i.v. group. BAL demonstrated significantly reduced cytokine levels 6 hours post-netrin-1 treatment (TNF-α: vehicle 633 ± 172 pg/ml, netrin-1 i.v. 84 ± 5 pg/ml, netrin-1 inh. 168 ± 74 pg/ml; both P {\textless} 0.05). MPO activity and protein content were significantly reduced in BAL samples from netrin-1-treated animals. Histological sections confirmed reduced inflammatory changes in the netrin-1-treated animals. Computed tomography corroborated reduced pulmonary damage in both netrin-1-treated groups.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that treatment with the endogenous anti-inflammatory protein netrin-1 reduces pulmonary inflammation during the initial stages of ALI and should be pursued as a future therapeutic option.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the applicability, efficacy, and safety of single-pass albumin dialysis in children.
DESIGN: Retrospective data review of uncontrolled clinical data.
SETTING: University-based pediatric intensive care unit collaborating with a local center for liver transplantation.
PATIENTS: Nine children, aged 2 to 15 yrs, who were treated with single-pass albumin dialysis for acute liver failure of various origins under a compassionate-use protocol between 2000 and 2006. All patients met high-urgency liver transplantation criteria.
INTERVENTIONS: Single-pass albumin dialysis was performed as rescue therapy for children with acute liver failure.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The decrease in hepatic encephalopathy (grades 1-4) and the serum levels of bilirubin, bile acids, and ammonium were measured to assess the efficacy of detoxification. As a measure of liver synthesis function, thromboplastin time and fibrinogen were analyzed. The safety of the procedure was assessed by documenting adverse effects on mean arterial blood pressure, platelet count, and clinical course. Seven out of nine patients were bridged successfully to either native organ recovery (n = 1) or liver transplantation (n = 6), one of them twice. Six out of nine patients undergoing single-pass albumin dialysis (ten treatments) survived. In six patients, hepatic encephalopathy could be reduced at least by one degree. Ammonium, bilirubin, and bile acid levels decreased in all patients. One patient had an allergic reaction to albumin.
CONCLUSIONS: In childhood acute liver failure, treatment with single-pass albumin dialysis was generally well tolerated and seems to be effective in detoxification and in improving blood pressure, thus stabilizing the critical condition of children before liver transplantation and facilitating bridging to liver transplantation. It may be beneficial in avoiding severe neurologic sequelae after acute liver failure and thereby improve survival. Single-pass albumin dialysis is an inexpensive albumin-based detoxification system that is easy to set up and requires little training. Whether and to what extent single-pass albumin dialysis can support children with acute liver failure until native liver recovery remains unclear.},

A similar development is expected for the field of proteomics, provided that affordable, very high-density peptide arrays are available. However, peptide arrays lag behind oligonucleotide arrays. This is mainly due to the monomer-by-monomer repeated consecutive coupling of 20 different amino acids associated with lithography, which adds up to an excessive number of coupling cycles. A combinatorial synthesis based on electrically charged solid amino acid particles resolves this problem. A computer chip consecutively addresses the different charged particles to a solid support, where, when completed, the whole layer of solid amino acid particles is melted at once. This frees hitherto immobilized amino acids to couple all 20 different amino acids in one single coupling reaction to the support. The method should allow for the translation of entire genomes into a set of overlapping peptides to be used in proteome research.},

The image processing method presented in this paper aims at controlling the quality of peptide arrays generated by particle based solid phase Merrifield combinatorial peptide synthesis. Incorrectly deposited particles are detected before the amino acids therein are coupled to the growing peptide. The calibration of the image acquisition is performed in a supervised training step in which all parameters of the quality analyzing algorithm are learnt given one representative image. Then, the correct deposition pattern is determined by a linear support vector machine. Knowing the pattern, contaminated areas can be detected by comparing the pattern with the actual deposition. Taking into account the resolution of the image acquisition system and its magnification factor, the number and size of contaminating particles can be calculated out of the number of connected foreground pixels.},

	abstract = {We identified the four-and-a-half LIM domain protein 2 (FHL2) as a novel regulator of CCL19-induced dendritic cell (DC) migration. Initiation of migration is a hallmark of DC function and plays a central role in the induction and regulation of immune responses. In vivo, DCs continuously acquire Ag in the periphery and migrate to draining lymph nodes, under the influence of local environmental chemotactic factors like CCL19/21 or sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P). We investigated the role of S1P- and RhoA-regulated FHL2 in this process. We found reduced nuclear localization of FHL2 in mature bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs), compared with immature BMDCs, following stimulation with CCL19. Furthermore, in vitro-generated murine FHL2(-/-) BMDCs displayed a significantly increased migratory speed, directionality, and migratory persistence toward the chemokine CCL19 compared with wild-type BMDCs. Moreover, in vivo, FHL2(-/-) BMDCs showed increased migration toward lymphoid organs. FHL2(-/-) BMDCs increased the expression of S1PR1, which was associated with greater Rac activation. An S1PR1 antagonist and knock-down of S1PR1 abrogated the increased migratory speed of FHL2(-/-) BMDCs. Our results identify FHL2 as an important novel regulator of DC migration via regulation of their sensitivity toward environmental migratory cues like S1P and CCL19.},

Furthermore, many had mental and cognitive problems that occur quite frequently even in children with light head trauma and often only manifest after release from hospital. This causes problems and results in inferior performance (26\%), especially at school, which is further complicated through lengthy periods of absence. The parents, especially, mentioned behavioral problems such as social withdrawal or aggressive demeanor, which led to tension also inside the family.

The surface of custom-built microchips can be equipped with an amino-modified poly(ethylene glycol)methacrylate (PEGMA) graft polymer coating, which permits high loading of functional groups and resists nonspecific protein adsorption. Specific microparticles that are addressed to the polymer-coated microchip surface in a well defined pattern release preactivated amino acids upon melting, and thus allow combinatorial synthesis of high-complexity peptide arrays directly on the chip surface. Currently, arrays with densities of up to 40,000 peptide spots/cm(2) can be generated in this way, with a minimum of coupling cycles required for full combinatorial synthesis. Without using any additional blocking agent, specific peptide recognition has been verified by background-free immunostaining on the chip-based array. This unit describes microchip surface modification, combinatorial peptide array synthesis on the chip, and a typical immunoassay employing the resulting high-density peptide arrays.},

Admittedly, these concepts have specific limitations, on one hand the number of synthesizable peptide sequences per area, on the other hand elaborate decoding/encoding strategies, false-positive results and sequence limitations. We recently established a method to produce high-density peptide arrays on microelectronic chips (4). Solid amino acid microparticles were charged by friction and transferred to defined pixel electrodes onto the chip's surface, where they couple to a functional polymer coating simply upon melting (Fig. 16.1 A-D,F). By applying standard Fmoc chemistry according to Merrifield, peptide array densities of up to 40,000 spots per square centimetre were achieved (Fig. 16.1G). The term "Merrifield synthesis" describes the consecutive linear coupling and deprotecting of L-amino acids modified with base-labile fluorenylmethoxy (Fmoc) groups at the N-terminus and different acid-sensitive protecting groups at their side chains. Removing side chain protecting groups takes place only once at the very end of each synthesis and generates the natural peptide sequence thereby.},

The updated guideline replaces the guideline issued in 2003.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The guideline forms the basis for developing an effective and efficient national early breast cancer detection program that meets the standards set by the Council of Europe and WHO for cancer control programs. The guideline presents the current, evidence- and consensus-based state of scientific knowledge in a multidisciplinary approach for the entire diagnostic chain, consisting of history taking and risk consultation, information on health behavior, clinical breast examination, diagnostic imaging, image-guided percutaneous tissue-acquisition techniques, open surgical excisional biopsy and pathomorphological tissue evaluation. The guideline recommends a set of quality indicators to assure resource availability, performance quality and outcomes enhancing total quality management for early breast cancer diagnosis.
CONCLUSION: Currently, early detection of breast cancer offers the most promising possibility to optimize the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer and, as a result, reduce breast cancer mortality and improve health related quality of life in women.},

The amount of sCD21 in serum may modulate immunity as the plasma levels are correlated with autoimmune conditions, such as Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, Rheumatoid Arthritis and Sjoegren's Syndrome. Because of the fact that pregnancy may lead to remission of autoimmune diseases we determined the serum levels of sCD21 during pregnancy and postpartum. The serum sCD21 levels during pregnancy are significantly lower as compared to that of the healthy controls. There were no significant differences in sCD21 levels between the mother and the cord blood also immediately after parturition. Restoration of sCD21 levels to normal values takes between 6 weeks and 1 year after childbirth.

	abstract = {In wheat sourdoughs, the degradation of gluten proteins is favored by acidification and reducing conditions. This study aimed to determine the proteolytic degradation of egg white proteins in wheat sourdoughs acidified with lactobacilli differing in their thiol metabolism. Ovotransferrin was the only major egg white protein that degraded during sourdough fermentations. An extensive degradation of ovotransferrin required a heterofermentative lactobacilli starter, Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis, with glutathione reductase activity. Ovotransferrin was more resistant to breakdown when sourdoughs were acidified with homofermentative lactobacilli or a mutant strain of L. sanfranciscensis lacking the glutathione reductase. Its susceptibility to proteolysis in L. sanfranciscensis sourdoughs is thus attributable to thiol accumulation by L. sanfranciscensis, which apparently altered the structure of ovotransferrin through a reduction of disulfide bonds. Proteolytic degradation of ovotransferrin was attributable to wheat aspartic proteinases. In addition to the susceptibility to proteolysis, other functional properties of egg proteins may be influenced by thiol-exchange reactions.},

	abstract = {We examined the high precision deposition of toner and polymer microparticles with a typical size of approximately 10 microm on electrode arrays with electrodes of 100 microm and below using custom-made microelectronic chips. Selective desorption of redundant particles was employed to obtain a given particle pattern from preadsorbed particle layers. Microparticle desorption was regulated by dielectrophoretic attracting forces generated by individual pixel electrodes, tangential detaching forces of an air flow, and adhesion forces on the microchip surface. A theoretical consideration of the acting forces showed that without pixel voltage, the tangential force applied for particle detachment exceeded the particle adhesion force. When the pixel voltage was switched on, however, the sum of attracting forces was larger than the tangential detaching force, which was crucial for desorption efficiency. In our experiments, appropriately large dielectrophoretic forces were achieved by applying high voltages of up to 100 V on the pixel electrodes. In addition, electrode geometries on the chip's surface as well as particle size influenced the desorption quality. We further demonstrated the compatibility of this procedure to complementary metal oxide semiconductor chip technology, which should allow for an easy technical implementation with respect to high-resolution microparticle deposition.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.surneu.2007.07.048},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Bleeding complications in neurosurgery often take alarming proportions without major hemodynamic effect or impairment of coagulation physiology because severe neurologic deficits are to be expected. Any measures used to stabilize or normalize coagulation are therefore of great interest. Administration of packed red cells, fresh frozen plasma, and platelet concentrates is associated with volume loading, which is suspected to multiply the secondary brain damage, for example, by the development of an edema. In this respect, the administration of rFVIIa may develop into a new option associated with low-volume administration.
CASE DESCRIPTIONS: We report on 5 neurosurgical patients to whom rFVIIa was given at doses of 51 to 202 microg/kg of body weight for the treatment of severe intraoperative bleeding (n = 3) or as prophylaxis of bleeding (n = 2). The operation was completed successfully in all patients after administration of rFVIIa, with stabilization of the coagulation status.
CONCLUSION: Therefore, reported cases constitute an approach in treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding complications in neurosurgery. There are reports of thromboembolic events in use of rFVIIa, particularly in unlabeled use. But according to our findings and current literature, there is no evidence of higher risk of thromboembolic adverse events in treatment with rFVIIa. However, the number of patients presented does not allow any final assessment to be made as to whether the properties of rFVIIa are of particular benefit for neurosurgical patients. Further studies with appropriate study design are required to verify effects observed in this investigation.},

We present a novel surface coating for CMOS microchips based on poly(ethylene glycol)methacrylate graft polymer films, which in addition provides high loadings of functional groups for the linkage of probe molecules. The coated microchips were compatible with the harshest conditions emerging in microarray generating methods, thoroughly retaining structural integrity and microelectronic functionality. Nonspecific adsorption of proteins on the chip's surface was completely obviated even with complex serum protein mixtures.

	title = {A study of climate change and anthropogenic impacts in {West} {Africa}},
	volume = {14},
	issn = {0944-1344},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND, AIM AND SCOPE: During the last decades ecological conditions in West Africa have dramatically changed. Very evident is the climate change, which has resulted in a southward shift of the climate zones, e.g. a spread of the desert (Sahara) into the Sahelian zone. After the drought period of the early 1970s and 1980s, livestock density increased resulting in an intensification of grazing pressure. This anthropogenous phenomenon leads to similar landscape changes as those caused by the climate. Only very few investigations exist on vegetation dynamics, climate changes and land use changes for the Sudanian zone. The paper presents data on changes of precipitation, of land use, of the geographical range of species, and of the composition of the flora, which have to be regarded as proofs of the sahelisation of large areas of the Sudanian zone.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Area of investigation: Burkina Faso. Precipitation data analysis: precipitation data from 67 stations; time series analysis and geo-statistical spatial interpolation. Analysis of land use change: Landsat satellite MSS and ETM+ data, acquired for two different dates between 1972 and 2001 analyzed by the software ERDAS/IMAGINE version 8.6 and ArcView 3.2 with the Spatial Analyst extension. Intensive ground truthing (160 training areas). Inventory of the flora: based on the data of the Herbarium Senckenbergianum (FR) in Frankfurt, Germany, and of the herbarium of the university of Ouagadougou (OUA), Burkina Faso, as well as on various investigations on the vegetation of Burkina Faso carried out in the years 1990 to 2005 by the team of the senior author. Life form analysis of the flora: based on the inventory of permanent plots.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Precipitation: Remarkable latitudinal shift of isohyets towards the South translates to a general reduction of average rainfall in great parts of the country. The last decade (1990-1999) shows some improvement, however, the more humid conditions of the 1950's and 1960's are not yet established again. Landcover change: In the study region the extent of arable fields and young fallows increased during the last 30 years from 580 km(2) in 1972 to 2870 km(2) in 2001. This means an average land cover conversion rate of 0.9\% per year for the 6 departments considered. Change of the distribution of Sahelian and Sudanian species: Several species, mentioned in older literature as strictly Sahelian, today also occur in the Sudanian zone. Parallel to the spread of former strictly Sahelian species into the Sudanian zone, some former Sahelo-Sudanian species have withdrawn from the Sahel. Changes of the life form spectra of the flora: Considering their life form spectra, the flora of heavily grazed and of protected areas in the Sudanian zone show great differences. On areas intensively grazed the percentage of therophytes is evidently higher than on protected areas. Just the opposite is true for the phanerophytes. Their percentage is higher on the protected area than on the grazed zones. At the first glance, it is obvious to link the changes in flora and vegetation with the climate changes that have occurred during the last five decades (decrease of annual precipitation). However, not only climatic conditions have changed, but also population has increased, the percentage of land intensively used for agriculture and pasturing has increased and the time for soil regeneration today is much shorter than it was some decades ago. Thus, the landscape of the Sudanian zone has become a more Sahelian character. A comparison of the flora of an intensively used area of the Sudanian zone with that of a protected area shows a remarkable change in the life form spectra. The spectrum of the intensively used area is almost identical with that of the typical Sahelian flora. This comparison shows that the anthropogenic influence plays a greater role in the sahelisation of the Sudanian zone than the climate change.
CONCLUSION: Climate change and anthropogenic influence both, lead to a sahelisation of landscape and flora. Thus in many parts of the Sudanian zone of West Africa sahelisation phenomena will remain and even increase independently from the reestablishment of the more humid climate conditions of the 1950ies.
RECOMMENDATIONS AND PERSPECTIVES: In order to maintain some parts of the characteristic Sudanian landscape with its characteristic flora and vegetation, the number and size of protected areas should be augmented. For all protected areas it has to be ensured, that protection is reality, i.e. respected an understood by local people, not only fiction. As long as the enlargement of intensively used areas continues the sahelisation of flora, vegetation and landscape will continue too.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The records of 159 patients were reviewed who routinely underwent a classical volume-pressure testing procedure due to suspected cerebrospinal fluid circulatory disorders.
METHODS: Regression analyses were carried out to explain the cerebrospinal parameters' relationships to age. Least median squares (LMS) algorithms achieved robust estimation of simple linear model parameters. Also, method of weighted regression was used because of unequal variances in the observations.
RESULTS: Cerebrospinal elastance and resistance to outflow revealed significant LMS regressions: y = 0.171x + 7.460 (n = 159, p {\textless} 0.0001) and y = 0.096x + 1.871 (n = 97, p {\textless} 0.0001), respectively. Similarly, weighting data resulted in models such as y = 0.151x + 6.830 (p {\textless} 0.0001) for elastance and y = 0.087x + 1.730 (p {\textless} 0.0001) for resistance estimates. The intracranial pressure at rest showed no age-related dependency. Both clear clinical and morphological signs were found in 20\% of patients.
CONCLUSION: Expecting no time-variant properties we surprisingly found a significant linear relationship in cerebrospinal parameters and age. Thus, parameter magnitudes are not likely dominated by a pathological process only but also determined by temporal system alterations.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Vitamin D may contribute to cardiovascular disease in the absence of hypercalcemia in patients with chronic kidney disease.
METHODS: We investigated the effects of long-term (6-week) treatment with 1,25(OH)2D3, at a non-hypercalcemic dosage (0.25 microg/kg per day per orally) in 5/6 nephrectomized rats: (i) vehicle-treated, sham-operated rats; (ii) 1,25(OH)2D3-treated, sham-operated rats; (iii) vehicle-treated, 5/6 nephrectomized rats; and (iv) 1,25(OH)2D3-treated, 5/6 nephrectomized rats.
RESULTS: Creatinine clearance after 6 weeks was significantly lower and parathyroid hormone levels were significantly higher in 1,25(OH)2D3-treated uremic rats, compared with uremic controls (P {\textless} 0.01). Serum calcium levels, as well as the calcium-phosphorus product, did not differ between both groups. Mean systolic blood pressure in 1,25(OH)2D3-treated animals was significantly increased, compared with vehicle (each P {\textless} 0.01). In addition, 1,25(OH)2D3-treated uremic animals showed left ventricular hypertrophy. Diffuse aortic calcification involving the intima and media layer occurred in 1,25(OH)2D3-treated uremic animals, but not in other groups. The mean aortic wall area and lumen area were increased two-fold in 1,25(OH)2D3-treated uremic animals compared with vehicle (P {\textless} 0.01), whereas the wall/lumen ratio remained unchanged, indicating fusiform aneurysm formation.
CONCLUSIONS: Hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy, aortic calcification, and aneurysm, without hypercalcemia, occurred in 1,25(OH)2D3-treated, 5/6 nephrectomized rats. These data indicate a permissive effect of uremia for cardiovascular damage induced by non-hypercalcemic doses of 1,25(OH)2D3.},

Only one early re-osteosynthesis with the same plate was necessary due to an initial non-correct reposition. As demonstrated by these good short-term results, this technique seems to be a suitable procedure for displaced humeral head fractures.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Few data are available concerning the frequency of bacteremia after diagnostic EUS or EUS-guided FNA. This study was undertaken to provide these data and to determine whether present guidelines for prophylactic administration of antibiotics to prevent endocarditis during upper endoscopy are applicable to EUS and EUS-guided FNA.
METHODS: A total of 100 patients who were to undergo diagnostic EUS of the upper-GI tract and 50 who were to have upper-GI EUS-guided FNA were enrolled in this prospective study. Blood cultures were obtained before and within 5 minutes after the conclusion of the procedure. In case of bacterial growth, patients were observed for at least 3 days for signs of infection.
RESULTS: After diagnostic EUS, significant bacteremia was found in two patients with esophageal carcinoma (2\%: 95\% CI[0\%, 4.8\%]) and after EUS-guided FNA in two patients (4\%: 95\% CI[0\%, 9.6\%]). The difference was not statistically significant. None of these patients developed clinical signs of infection. Risk factors predisposing to bacteremia could not be identified.
CONCLUSION: The frequency of bacteremia after EUS, with and without FNA, is within the range of that for diagnostic upper endoscopy. Therefore, the same recommendations for prophylactic administration of antibiotics to prevent endocarditis may be applied in patients undergoing EUS and EUS-guided FNA. The role of esophageal cancer as a predisposing factor to EUS-associated infection remains uncertain.},

	abstract = {After a caries decline of about 80\% in children in Western Europe and other industrialized countries, there should be critical debate about the best way for future caries prevention. Multiple fluoride use played an important role in caries reductions achieved in the 1980s and 1990s, but it also resulted in a polarization of lesion distribution in young people: the majority consists of low-caries or even lesion-free individuals, while a minority is a so-called high caries risk group which seems not to be open to preventive programs. Recent studies indicate that frequent fluoride applications ({\textgreater}6 times/year) in conjunction with effective plaque removal can be a successful approach for effective future caries prevention in high caries risk groups. Health promotion programs that are merely educational and do not provide fluoride do not seem to be effective. Alternatively, preventive measures could be performed at home or in a private practice, but only minimal compliance is reached in high risk groups compared with out-reaching group programs. Thus, group programs are instrumental in providing effective and efficient caries-preventive measures in children. The more expensive time of a dental practice team should be limited to procedures where costly equipment is needed (professional tooth cleaning, sealants, etc.). For efficient caries prevention, measures formerly targeted specifically at either populations, groups, or individuals should be remodeled and aimed to interact in order to achieve optimal oral health in children at a reasonable cost.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Calcium-channel blockade impairs renal autoregulation in animals. Impaired renal autoregulation leads to transmission of the systemic blood pressure (BP) into the glomerulus, resulting in capillary hypertension. Information on the impact of calcium antagonist treatment on renal autoregulation in humans is lacking. This study examines the effect of isradipine treatment on the autoregulation of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR).
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed a randomized double-blind crossover study with 5 mg o.d. isradipine retard and matching placebo in 16 hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes. Each treatment arm lasted 4 weeks. On the last day of each treatment period, GFR (single-shot 51Cr-EDTA plasma clearance technique for 4 h) was measured twice between 8:00 A.M. and 5:00 P.M., first without clonidine and then after intravenous injection of 75 micro g clonidine. BP was measured every 10 min (Takeda TM2420; A\&D, Tokyo).
RESULTS: Clonidine reduced mean arterial BP (MABP) by 15 +/- 1 vs. 11 +/- 1 mmHg (means +/- SE) during placebo and isradipine treatment, respectively (P {\textless} 0.05). GFR was reduced from 102 +/- 4 to 99 +/- 4 ml. min(-1). 1.73 m(-2) with placebo (P {\textless} 0.01) and from 106 +/- 5 to 98 +/- 5 ml. min(-1). 1.73 m(-2) during treatment with isradipine (P {\textless} 0.01). Mean difference (95\% CI) between changes in GFR with placebo and isradipine was -4.6 ml. min(-1). 1.73 m(-2) (-10.0 to 0.6) (P = 0.08). Six patients had a reduction in GFR {\textgreater}13\% (exceeding the normal limit of autoregulation) combined with a complete pressure-passive vasculature (defined as DeltaMABP\% {\textless} or = DeltaGFR\%) during isradipine treatment versus none during the placebo treatment (P {\textless} 0.05).

	volume = {43},
	issn = {0013-9580},
	abstract = {PURPOSE: The antiepileptic drug vigabatrin (VGB) increases intracellular availability of the inhibitory transmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) by inhibition of GABA-transaminase. A blockade of the GABA uptake is the main mechanism of action of tiagabine (TGB). Based on this, the two antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) can be speculated to act synergistically so that their combined antiepileptic efficacy is supraadditive.
METHODS: To test this, experiments were performed on hippocampal slices of guinea-pigs. As an epilepsy model, epileptiform field potentials (EFPs) were induced by omission of Mg2+ from the bath solution and recorded in stratum pyramidale of the CA3 region. VGB (7.5 microM) and TGB (0.75 microM) were added to the superfusate.
RESULTS: VGB, given alone, failed to decrease the repetition rate of EFPs. Similarly, TGB applied alone only transiently led to a nonsignificant reduction of the EFP frequency. Combining VGB and TGB, their suppressive efficacy increased, yielding a significant reduction of EFP frequency, which, however, again did not persist. Pretreatment of the preparations with VGB for 2 h, followed by additional application of TGB, or TGB alone, drastically and persistently potentiated the effects.
CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that VGB and TGB show favorable pharmacodynamic interactions, provided VGB is allowed to block intracellular GABA degradation before GABA uptake block by TGB.},

In The Hague, The Netherlands, a sample of 345 10- to 13-year-olds and 400 15- and 16-year-olds was clinically examined. The criteria for the assessment of smooth-bordered tooth wear ('smooth wear') were in line with the diagnostic criteria for erosion developed by Lussi (1996). In the age group 10-13 years, the percentage of subjects with visible smooth wear (SW1 threshold) was 3\% and in 1 subject (0.3\%), deep smooth enamel wear was found. Due to the low prevalence, the results for this age group were not analysed further. In the age group 15-16 years, the proportion of subjects with visible smooth wear (SW1 threshold) was 30\% and that with at least deep smooth enamel wear (SW2 threshold) 11\%. Smooth wear into dentine was found in 1 subject. First molars and upper anterior teeth were affected predominantly. A significant effect on visible smooth wear (SW1 threshold) was found for gender and social background. At mouth level, no significant influence was found for dietary patterns, drinking habits or oral hygiene practices. The caries prevalence was similar in subjects with and without smooth wear.},

	doi = {10.1055/s-2002-19510},
	abstract = {A group of experts from 4 European countries who gathered at a convention at Basel in November 1998, arrived at the recommendation to increase the fluoride (= F) content of toddler toothpastes from 250 ppm to 500 ppm. It was recommended to make parents brush the children's teeth with a pea-size piece of this toothpaste once a day, starting when the first deciduous teeth were erupting. Routine application of F-tablets would no longer be routinely prescribed, but restricted to individual indications in special high caries risk cases. This recommendation did not consider previous ones and was based exclusively on new scientific, mainly epidemiological evidence. In April 2000 the recommendation was officially issued by the German scientific dental association DGZMK.A careful case-control study resulted in the analysis of the risk to develop mottling of enamel under the influence of fluoridated water (1 ppm F) and fluoride toothpaste (1000 ppm F) when used in early childhood. It was found that excessive use of the fluoride toothpaste doubled the fluorosis risk, whereas when fluoride supplements (tablets, drops) were given the risk was about 20 times higher than without a fluoride supplement. Experiments in Germany and the Netherlands had shown that remineralisation of enamel under influence of 500 ppm F is achieved much more quickly than under application of 250 ppm F. A panel of WHO experts came to the conclusion that there was no evidence for the effectiveness of toothpastes containing less than 500 ppm. Statistics from the Netherlands have shown that the amount of fluoride tablets sold there is barely sufficient for the use by a quarter of all children 0 to 4 years old. In contrast to this low level of acceptance of fluoride tablets, fluoride toothpastes is widely accepted. It is their extensive use which explains the marked improvement of dentitions among the youth in this country during the last 20 years; the influence of topical fluoride gels, varnishes and other preventive measures was much less, and a reduction of sugar consumption (by the way less than 10 \% of what it was in 1970) seems to have been the least important factor. The new recommendations based on topical rather than systemic fluoride application are better for preventive, toxicological, psychological and didactic reasons and should be implemented as soon as possible.},

Provided the blood-brain barrier is intact, glycerol is regarded as a potential marker for membrane phospholipid degradation. The authors report a case in which marked elevation of interstitial glycerol was induced after exogenous administration of a glycerol-containing agent. A 25-year-old man was injured in a motorcycle accident and was admitted to the authors' institution with a unilateral dilated and fixed pupil and a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 3. Computerized tomography scans revealed a large subdural hematoma on the left side, subsequent midline shift, and generalized edema. Emergency craniotomy was performed for evacuation of the hematoma. The patient was prepared for multisensory monitoring and a microdialysis catheter was inserted into his left frontal lobe. After a routine enema containing 85\% glycerol had been administered, the authors measured a marked increase in glycerol in the dialysate. This occurred while the patient was in as stable a condition as could be expected given the circumstances. The increase in interstitial glycerol in the injured tissue was most likely due to an impaired blood-brain barrier. Thus, the interstitial glycerol concentration had been corrupted by exogenous glycerol, and the marker properties of glycerol in this case became questionable. Consequently, administration of glycerol, which is frequently found in various infusions and emulsions, can promote secondary brain damage by adversely shifting osmotic gradients.},

When these steps do not achieve an adequate metabolism, insulinotropic substances (sulphonyl urea or repaglinid) as well as biguanides and inhibitors of the disaccaridase (acarbose and meglitol) are available for further treatment. In the future, thiazolidindione may be applied which primarily increases the sensitivity for insulin. All these drugs may be combined with insulin application once or more often a day i.e. by the bolus principle. Mostly in older patients however, a conventional insulin therapy with a fixed daily rhythm has to be recommended when oral antidiabetic agents fail. When a patient asks for more flexibility, one should not hesitate to teach even the older patient the intensified insulin therapy.},

	abstract = {Prediction of outcome after shunt-therapy in chronic hydrocephalus syndrome is uncertain. Pathology reveals an impairment of cerebral blood flow (CBF). Based on this, we evaluated CBF and its significance for the assessment of prognosis. In 21 patients (mean age 69 years) selected for surgery, CBF was measured by PET (15O-H2O) before, about one week and 7 months (n = 14) after shunting. CBF was computed by a 1-compartmental model in the territories of the ACA, MCA and PCA. One PET slice in the height of the maximum projection of both cellae mediae was chosen. CBF data were standardized by cluster analysis. Three CBFClusters with significantly different CBF levels prior to shunting in the ACA, MCA and PCA territory, respectively, referred to the sample average (38.2 ml/100 ml/min) were found. These CBFClusters differed in clinical outcome: almost 50\% and 90\% of patients improved clinically in CBFCluster I, with a perfusion level lower than average, after one week and 7 months, respectively. In contrast, patients of CBFCluster II with an average perfusion did not improve. CBF changes 7 months after shunting related to global CBF before surgery showed a relationship with the clinical course. Clinical outcome corresponded with preoperative global CBF values. Cerebral blood flow lower than average forecasts clinical improvement. Our results suggest that measurement of CBF adds to the indication for surgery.},

	abstract = {The management of intracranial pressure (ICP) is a factor in outcome of patients with head trauma. However, recent studies have revealed that the current strategies, which have been applied to control ICP for adequate cerebral perfusion, are unsatisfactory. Against this background, the efficacy of short-term infusions of hypertonic saline on ICP was investigated. In severely head injured (SHI) patients, hypertonic saline (100 ml 10\% NaCl) was administered when standard agents (mannitol, sorbitol, THAM) failed in reducing ICP. To evaluate the pressure reduction after saline infusions the resulting ICP relaxations were analysed statistically in respect to the parameters amplitude, duration and dynamic behaviour of the ICP responses. In 42 randomized relaxations, the relative ICP decrease was 43\% [28\%-58\%] (median [interquartile range]). The corresponding pressure drop was 18 mmHg [15-27 mm Hg]. Relaxations lasted for 93 min [64-126 min] and a relative ICP minimum was reached 26 min [12-33 min] after infusion. In the individual cases the temporal course of the parameters amplitude and decline interval depict a tendency toward lower and higher values, respectively, under conditions of a generally increasing ICP. As expected, the infusion of hypertonic saline reduces ICP in patients suffering from SHI. The pressure drop, duration and dynamic behaviour are suspected to depend both on the pressure level to reduce and concomitant medications.},

A procedure is described to extrapolate from measured 90Sr activity of the skull bone to total 90Sr skeleton burden. As a result, 90Sr whole-body activities of up to 50 kBq were recorded in the selected cohort. For the same individuals, 90Sr was measured via the detection of bremsstrahlung using an established whole-body counting device.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the effect of a chlorhexidine varnish on occlusal caries incidence when applied 6-monthly into the fissures of erupting and freshly erupted permanent molars.
METHODS: In a double-blind clinical trial, 332 children aged 5/6 and 11/12 years attending a Child Dental Health Centre were randomly assigned to a control and an experimental group. Criteria for inclusion in the study were that all first permanent molars in 5-6-year-olds and all second permanent molars in 11-12-year-olds either had recently erupted, or were in a stage of eruption, or would erupt within half a year. At baseline, counts of dmfs/DMFS and mutans streptococci in saliva were recorded. During a maximum of 3 years, every 6 months the occlusal surfaces of molars in the experimental group received a 40\% chlorhexidine varnish application, whereas those in the control group received a placebo varnish application.
RESULTS: Data of 316 children were analysed and ANOVA showed no significant occlusal caries reduction in this sample of Dutch 5/6- and 11/12-year-old children. After stratification into low and high caries risk groups, a statistically significant caries-reducing effect on occlusal caries in permanent molars was found in the group of children with {\textgreater} or = 10(6) mutans streptococci per ml saliva (P {\textless} 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Six-monthly application of chlorhexidine varnish has no caries-reducing effect on occlusal caries in recently erupted permanent molars in a population with low caries prevalence.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: To determine the accuracy and safety of a modified intra-arterial calcium stimulation with the venous sampling test (ASVS) for preoperative localization of insulinomas. Modification included stimulation with a fixed low dose of calcium gluconate, additional stimulation in the distal splenic artery, and no insulin sampling in the left hepatic vein.
METHODS: In 10 patients showing biochemical evidence of organic hyperinsulinemia, 0.45 mmol of Ca2+ was injected into the gastroduodenal, superior mesenteric, proper hepatic, proximal, and distal splenic arteries during angiography. Insulin levels were measured in samples taken from the right hepatic vein before and 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, and 300 s after Ca2+ injection.
RESULTS: Insulin gradients with an increase of more than fourfold indicated direct tumor supply, two- to fourfold correlated with collateral supply, and less than twofold correlated with normal tissue vascularization. ASVS localized all the adenomas of the pancreatic head (n = 3) and body (n = 2) and two of four adenomas of the tail correctly, as confirmed by surgery. Two adenomas of the proximal pancreatic tail were erroneously localized to the body segment, but the fault was rectified by angiography. In one patient with a negative ASVS and without exploration, the diagnosis of an insulinoma was revised.
CONCLUSION: ASVS with a fixed low dose of calcium gluconate is a highly accurate and safe method for preoperative localization of insulinomas. Sampling in the left hepatic vein can be routinely omitted. Additional stimulation in the distal splenic artery seems helpful in surgical decision making, but additional experience is needed.},

	abstract = {Different distributions of fluorotic dental enamel within the dentition have been described in the literature. This report describes two patterns of intraoral distribution. In nine Tanzanian low fluorosis communities with a prevalence of pitting fluorosis of less than 2\% and in five moderate fluorosis communities with a prevalence of pitting fluorosis of 16-59\%, incisors and first molars were the least affected teeth. In four high fluorosis communities with a prevalence of pitting fluorosis of 86-97\%, maxillary incisors exhibited lower Thylstrup-Fejerskov Index values than the maxillary canines, premolars and molars. The mandibular teeth exhibited increasing Thylstrup-Fejerskov Index values from the anterior to the posterior region. The curves presenting the intraoral distribution of the severity of dental fluorosis corresponded with the curve presenting the completion time of primary enamel formation of the various tooth types, with the exception of the first molars in high fluorosis communities. The similarity of the curves suggests that the later in life enamel is completed, the higher is the severity of dental fluorosis. This relation seems to be explained by the prevailing feeding and dietary habits, which result in minimal intake of fluoride in the first 18 months of life during breastfeeding, followed by increasing fluoride ingestion in the following years through consumption of tea, seafish and F-containing magadi salt.},

	abstract = {It has recently been suggested that magadi, a high-fluoride trona, which is added in cooking to tenderize certain vegetables and beans in two villages in Tanzania, significantly contributed to the prevalence and severity of dental fluorosis. This report aims to substantiate the significance of magadi as a determinant of dental fluorosis. Eighteen villages in four geographical areas (districts) with water supplies containing 0.2 to 0.8 mg/L of fluoride were selected. All schoolchildren aged 12 to 17 years (n = 1566) who had been born and raised in these villages were examined for dental fluorosis according to the Thylstrup-Fejerskov Index. Dietary history was recorded. The fluoride content of magadi samples was determined and the urinary fluoride excretion of pre-schoolchildren was assessed. The prevalence of dental fluorosis in nine coastal villages where tea and seafish were regularly consumed ranged from 7\% to 46\%. Severe (pitting) dental fluorosis was rarely seen. The low fluorosis levels observed in non-magadi consuming communities in coastal villages indicate that a fluoride content of up to 0.8 mg/L in drinking water is acceptable under the prevailing conditions of temperature and diet. In contrast, the prevalence of dental fluorosis in nine villages located inland at 1500 m altitude, where fluoride-containing magadi was consumed, ranged from 53\% to 100\%, and severe (pitting) fluorosis was highly prevalent, ranging from 18\% to 97\%. The village with the highest fluoride content in the magadi samples collected showed the highest level of fluorosis. The urinary fluoride excretion of pre-schoolchildren from different villages corresponded with the level of fluorosis and the fluoride content in the magadi samples of the respective villages. Data on dental fluorosis from the magadi-consuming communities provide strong evidence that consumption of magadi was the major determinant of the observed high prevalence and severity of fluorosis in inland villages at 1500 m altitude.},

Regarding dietary factors, it must be remembered that hidden sugars in fruit as well as polysaccharides are cariogenic. The most important of the other factors is regular tooth brushing, which results in the removal of the bacterial plaque that causes caries and periodontal diseases and makes fluoride (which is contained in every advanced toothpaste) available for maintenance of the hard dental tissues and for remineralization wherever demineralization has occurred. This explains why in most highly developed countries caries prevalence has decreased markedly during the past 20 y although consumption of sugars remained high.},

A total of 1565 children aged between 11 and 18 yr with a mean age of 14.7 were examined for dental fluorosis with the TFI and 1155 of these children were also examined with the DI. The measurement error for the TFI was 0.50 (10 scale point) compared to 0.53 for DI (6 scale point). The Kappa values and the measurement-remeasurement correlation appeared to be better for the TFI. No difficulties were encountered in applying the TFI in contrast to the DI, which caused uncertainties in assessing the "questionable" and "very mild" scores, and this may explain the relatively better reproducibility of the TFI. The correspondence between both indices was determined. TFI 0 corresponded well with DI 0. The conversion values for TFI 1, 2, 3 and 4 into DI scores were 0.3, 0.8, 1.4 and 2.4 respectively. The TFI 5-9 corresponded with DI score 4. TFI could discriminate the severe forms of dental fluorosis which were categorized in Dean's highest score 4. TFI was able to reveal more dental fluorosis than DI in communities with minor and moderate dental fluorosis. In the community with severe dental fluorosis where more than 85\% of all teeth exhibited a DI {\textgreater} or = 1, both indices revealed a comparable prevalence of dental fluorosis.

Epidemiological studies, including data on the increasing numbers of elderly subjects, will remain important in the future; epidemiologists require better methods of diagnosing small lesions and of identifying risk groups. Sophisticated computer simulation models for the processing of epidemiological data might result in more accurate predictions and may enable health policy planners to invest scarce funds in the most efficient manner. These efforts should be focused on improving school health education and prevention strategies in general. The main difference between (sub)populations with low caries prevalence and high caries prevalence seems to be the lack of regular toothbrushing with a fluoride toothpaste by members of the high prevalence subpopulation. Since, in many countries, toothbrushing has been accepted by 80 per cent of the population, it should be possible to get this habit adopted by the minorities still at high risk. Future research with the highest priority should be behavioural studies into (dental) health education with personal hygiene as the main goal. Socio-psychologists should conduct research into the possibilities of motivating people to practice oral hygiene and hygiene-minded behaviour in general. This would not only improve oral health, but at the same time would tackle what still is the greatest threat to mankind: infectious diseases.},

Psychological assessments with questionnaires were also performed and comprised: personality evaluation; physical complaints; possible predisposing features for the development of MI; expectations regarding the benefit of rehabilitation; circumstances at the time of infarction; and socioeconomic and historical data. The hypothesis that physiological factors might explain the differences between AMI and SMI is not substantiated by our results. However, the hypothesis of the role of psychological factors is supported. As opposed to AMI patients, SMI patients are characterized by frequent complaints of poor health, neuroticism, and introversion. At the time of infarction, SMI patients had more frequent premonitory symptoms of longer duration. Moreover, SMI patients had more frequent previous hospital or nursing home admissions.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the validator and the validation system (stereomicroscopy or radiography of tooth sections) on the outcome of diagnostic tests for occlusal caries. The material consisted of 60 extracted third molars which were serially sectioned (500-600 microns thick). Four observers examined the sections by two caries validation methods: stereomicroscopy and film radiography. The presence of caries in the occlusal surfaces of these teeth had previously been recorded by visual inspection and conventional film radiography. The kappa values for interobserver agreement within one validation method ranged from 0.44 to 0.76 for radiography and from 0.47 to 0.60 for microscopy. The intraobserver agreement with the two methods was low (range 0.31-0.49), and by cross-tabulating the data, it was found that the disagreements originated in a consistently deeper lesion score with stereomicroscopy than with radiography by all observers except 1. By use of receiver operating characteristic curve areas, little impact of the validation method was seen when visual inspection was validated (against microscopy mean area = 0.75, against radiography mean area = 0.74). The mean receiver operating characteristic area was higher when diagnostic film radiographs were validated against radiography (0.68) than against microscopy (0.63). The differences between observers within a validation method were larger with microscopy than with radiography. In conclusion, caries validation methods are subject to variability.

The occlusal surfaces of 81 third permanent molar teeth extracted from young adolescents were diagnosed by four examiners, who measured the electrical resistance of enamel on a one measurement per surface basis, and furthermore assessed the occlusal surfaces visually and radiographically. The teeth were sectioned for validation by histological examination. The ERM had the highest sensitivity (0.67), and visual inspection had the highest specificity (0.89). ROC analysis showed no statistically significant differences between the performance of the observers when using visual inspection and ERM (z-score test; P {\textgreater} 0.05). One examiner performed statistically significantly better by measuring the electrical resistance of enamel than by radiographic examination (P {\textless} 0.05). The average sensitivity and specificity of the three diagnostic systems were used to express the positive and negative predictive values as a function of caries prevalence.

All methods of caries prevention, with the exception of population-administered measures such as fluoridation of drinking water or domestic salt, can only work when applied regularly and conscientiously. For this reason behavioural aspects such as compliance and the chances for widespread (if not universal) application have to be considered. There is indirect evidence that toothbrushing with fluoride toothpastes is a highly probable explanation for the decline of caries prevalence in developed countries since the 70s; moreover, toothbrushing, and the use of therapeutic dentifrices, is considered to meet spreading compliance because a 'healthy mouth' becomes more and more socially desirable in growing numbers of subpopulations.},

Imaging methods may therefore be needed to aid in the visual detection of occlusal caries. It was the aim of this study to evaluate diagnostic accuracy in a laboratory set-up of visual inspection (VI), fiber-optic-transillumination (FOTI), conventional radiography (CR), and two digital radiographic image modalities (DRm and DRr) for detection of occlusal caries in clinically non-cavitated teeth. Eighty-one extracted third molars from 18-20-year-old males were assessed by four observers on a five-rank confidence scale by the five methods. Ground sections (500-600 microns) served as validation for true state of disease: 1 = no caries in dentin, 2 = caries just beyond dentino-enamel junction, or 3 = deep dentinal caries, halfway or more to the pulp. ROC analysis was performed on the basis of the confidence rank scale data on two diagnostic thresholds, T1 = caries in dentin (disease state 2+3) and T2 = caries deep in dentin (state 3). On the T1 level, use of the FOTI method gave on average the most accurate diagnosis, closely followed by VI, both performing better than use of radiography. On the T2 level, all five diagnostic methods performed equally well.},

The sample investigated consisted of 13 children for whom 4 premolar and 19 molar teeth were judged to require a sealant. The indication was based on the criteria 'fissure discoloration', 'enamel decalcification' and 'absence of dentinal decay'. For predefined locations within these occlusal fissures a diagnosis was obtained by the following diagnostic systems: clinical examination, examination on fiber-optic transillumination (FOTI), fissure discoloration, electrical resistance measurement, radiographic examination and ratings of fissure morphology. Tooth material was removed until no (more) carious enamel or dentin was left. Two dentists then jointly decided on the status of decay for each of the defined locations within the fissure. These ratings served as the 'gold standard' diagnoses. The electrical resistance measurement with a sensitivity of 0.96 and a specificity of 0.71 was the only diagnostic tool with acceptable performance. Radiographic diagnosis was characterized by a moderate sensitivity and specificity. All other diagnostic systems had either very low sensitivities or very low specificities, or both. The positive predictive value of FOTI examination and the negative predictive value of the electrical resistance measurements were very high, irrespective of the prevalence of occlusal dentinal decay.},

	abstract = {In general, the prevalence of caries in African children may be classified as low to very low. In order to reduce this level even further, methods including the practice of good oral hygiene and administration of fluoride, e.g. water fluoridation, have been suggested. In 1984, 1986 and 1988, a mixed-longitudinal study amongst schoolchildren was carried out in a rural and urban area of Tanzania. In the rural area, shallow wells had been constructed at different periods in time in eight villages since the late 1970s. The drinking water in three of the villages contained fluoride in the range of 0.5-0.8 ppm (fluoridated) and contained less than 0.4 ppm fluoride in the remaining five villages (non-fluoridated). These fluoride levels were disclosed to the authors only during the course of the study. Thus the data were reanalysed to investigate the effects of fluoride and length of fluoride exposure on caries experience in the deciduous dentition. The study was carried out amongst 522 7- and 8-year-olds. Fluoride tablets were not used and toothpaste was virtually unavailable. Three periods of fluoride exposure were identified, i.e. 3, 5 and 7 years. The outcome variable was the mean dmft score in deciduous molars whereas the explanatory variables were age, length of fluoride exposure and year of investigation. Nutrition was considered a co-variate. Analysis of co-variance revealed a fluoride effect (p = 0.0004). Regression analysis did not show significant relationships between the mean dmft score and the three periods of fluoride exposure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

Formerly, the cause of these root destructions was usually caries attack due to a failure of patients to practise adequate oral hygiene measures. However, with increasing dental motivation and health consciousness, patients--for example in the USA, Scandinavian countries and Switzerland--cause such lesions by vigorous, badly controlled brushing, often in combination with the consumption of 'healthy' vegetarian, erosive diets. The former problem of carious root destruction due to neglect thus seems to be gradually being replaced by the problem that self-care is not yet thoroughly understood, is exaggerated and is technically inadequate. Faulty brushing may result in severe damage to those gingival sites that require attention cariologically as well as periodontologically. To exploit all possibilities of (secondary) preventive management of patients, careful investigation and analysis of the clinical signs is required to identify the aetiology of the lesions in each case. Fortunately, therapeutic management of root lesions, regardless of their aetiology, is facilitated by modern restorative techniques and materials.},

On the other hand, dental awareness and multiple sources of fluoride have increased the risk of chronic fluoride overdosage. Means to avoid the latter problem are discussed. In addition to community-delivered fluoridation programs, individual counseling and "tailor-made" preventive measures are of increasing importance.},

Therefore parallel clinical and radiographic examination of approximal surfaces were carried out in 317 14-year-old children. To assess the degree of agreement between both methods sensitivity and negative predictive value were determined. At the same time previously published data of children aged 8 through 12 years were reassessed. From the results it is concluded that omission of radiographic examination will not result in a substantial loss of information under the age of 12, but above this age it is advisable to include radiographic diagnosis for approximal surfaces.},

We have developed a special algorithm that compares the values for heart rate and activity of a particular minute with the values of the previous minutes. If heart rate of a specific minute exceeds the rate of the previous minutes without an accompanying increase of activity, an emotional event may possibly be assumed. In such a case, the patient is requested by a beep signal to answer relevant questions about what he is doing, how he feels, etc. Moreover the patient is allowed to activate the system for himself for special events, e.g. chest pain.

	abstract = {Sixty-nine blood or bone marrow samples from both children and adults with acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) were investigated to elucidate the frequency of immunoglobulin (IG) and T-cell receptor (TCR)-gene rearrangements. Non-germline configuration for the IG heavy chain (h) gene was detected in the specimens of nine patients of various subtypes according to the French-American-British classification (FAB), including FAB M1, M2, M4 and M5. Rearrangement of the IG kappa chain (k) gene was present in one of these cases which simultaneously revealed a rearranged TCR-beta (b) chain gene. In another two AML samples we found TCR-b gene rearrangements, in one case in combination with an IG-h gene rearrangement. IG-h gene rearrangements were detected in 10 cases, in one case in conjunction with an IG-kappa (k) and TCR-b gene rearrangement. A highly significant correlation between the occurrence of DNA rearrangements of the IG-h locus and nuclear staining with the enzyme terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) and surface expression of the CD 19 and CD 34 antigen could be identified: all 10 TdT positive AML samples rearranged IG-h. Similarly, six out of 69 AML samples exhibited surface expression of CD 19, five of these in combination with CD 34 and all of them rearranged the IG-h gene. The one leukemia with TCR-b gene rearrangement only was TdT positive as well, but did not express CD 19 or CD 34. We conclude that IG-h gene is rearranged in a substantial proportion of AML, strongly associated with a specific immunophenotype (TdT+, CD19+, CD34+), whereas TCR-b gene rearrangement appears more rarely. No positive correlation between occurrence of IG-h and TCR-b gene-rearrangements and one AML FAB-subtype was found, although a clustering of M1 and M4 FAB subtypes in the AML group showing reconstructed IG-h gene became evident.},

A sample of 29 schools stratified according to SES and randomly assigned to two groups was selected. One group of schools (14) performed weekly rinsing and the other group (15) served as controls.

	abstract = {In many Western societies caries experience in children has decreased substantially in areas both with and without organized preventive programs or water fluoridation. In the majority of studies reporting declining caries activity, cross-sectional data of the same age groups are compared. The purpose of the present study is to provide longitudinal data on the progress of dental caries in permanent first molars. 252 caries-active children, initially 8-yr old, were followed up from 1979 to 1983. At all three examinations lower socioeconomic (SES) children had a significantly higher caries experience than children the same age in middle and high SES classes. The D2MF-S counts did not change between age 8 and 10, but increased steeply between 10 and 12 yr of age. The D3MF-S counts, on the other hand, rose steadily in all SES classes. The phenomenon was caused by the progression of enamel lesions to dentinal lesions or fillings, leading to a concomitant decrease in the curves of incipient caries lesions (D2). The rise from age 10 to 12 is attributable to new developing enamel lesions. With regard to predilection sites, at all ages and in every SES class, the highest proportion of both indices was due to lesions in occlusal surfaces, followed by buccal and lingual pits and fissures. The approximal sites were the least affected.},

	abstract = {In 1969, 1972, 1975 and 1978 dental examinations were carried out in the City of The Hague on cohorts of about 800 children from kindergartens and elementary schools in order to test a (dental) health education program. Since 1980/1981 weekly fluoride mouthrinses have been done in kindergartens and elementary schools in areas with lower SES. In 1981, a baseline dental examination for a follow-up study was carried out on about 500 second grade schoolchildren from areas of low and medium SES. In this baseline examination in 1981 a considerable improvement in dental health was found compared with the earlier cohort examinations, especially in medium SES groups. The average D3MFS value in 1981 was 1.53 and 0.92 for second grade children of the low and medium social level respectively; the average d3fs values were 5.83 and 3.42. Over the 12-yr period (1969-1981) a respective D3MFS reduction of 57.6 and 76.2\% was found for low and medium SES. The percentage d3fs reduction for the primary dentition was 55.3 and 72.9\%, respectively. In 1978 and 1981 the percentage of children without gingivitis was 26.8 and 31.9\%. The difference in the number of gingivitis-free children between 1978 and 1981 seemed to be due to an increase in the number of children without gingivitis in the medium SES groups. A greater use of fluoride tablets was found in low and medium socioeconomic levels between 1972 and 1975, followed by a decrease in the period between 1975 and 1978 and another increase by 1981 compared with 1978.},

The activation volume further proves to be pressure-independent but exhibits a pronounced negative temperature coefficient. The volume changes connected with the entrance of para-nitrophenyl phosphate, calcium or magnesium ions into the substrate ion complex are quite small, indicating that the transfer of water connected with the binding of these ligands is compensated by volume changes of the protein, accompanying the transition of the enzyme from its activated into its ground state.},

The proposed method has good performance characteristics and is not influenced by the presence of reduced neopterine in urine. Using this HPLC method, urinary neopterine related to creatinine was determined for 148 healthy male adults (mean neopterine/creatinine 113 mumol/mol), 146 healthy female adults (mean neopterine/creatinine 140 mumol/mol) 60 healthy children (mean neopterine/creatinine 163 mumol/mol).

Only 15\% of these patients had elevated neopterine levels. The mean urinary neopterine levels correlated well with the tumor stage in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and with non-Hodgkin's disease. In patients with chronic leukaemia those without hepatosplenomegaly excreted significantly more neopterine than controls, and patients with hepatosplenomegaly significantly more than those without hepatosplenomegaly. It is concluded that urinary neopterine levels are of value for following the progression of haematological neoplasias.},

The aim of this investigation was to assess what changes, if any, in dental health may have taken place as a result of the campaign "Haagse Aktie', based on dietary and dental health education. In the 5-, 7- and 9-year-old children no differences in dental health were found between 1969 and 1972. The first considerable improvement was found in 1975, especially in children from high social levels. In 1978 the children showed an even better dental health, compared with 1975. In the 5-year-old children the average d3mfs was 6.8. The average D3MFS in children of 7, 9 and 11 years of age in 1978 was 1.8, 3.9 and 8.2. At all socioeconomic levels the improvement of dental health was due to a considerable increase in the percentage of caries free children between 1975 and 1978; 27.6\% 51.8\%, 21.2\% and 7.4\%, respectively, of the 5-, 7-, 9- and 11-year-old children were caries free in 1978, compared with 10.0\%, 14.2\%, 3.1\% and 0.9\% in 1975.

The impairment of cell proliferation after irradiation was determined by flow cytometry (FCM) and 3H-autoradiography after in vitro incubation. From FCM DNA distributions the fractions of cells in the phases of cell cycle were computed. The results show good agreement between the S-phase fractions determined by FCM and autoradiography. Preliminary data from 14 patients, 5 preirradiated and 9 unirradiated show that the fraction of cells in S-phase was reduced from 0.06 +/- 0.03 in the unirradiated patients to 0.01 +/- 0.01 in the irradiated ones. 12 of the 14 adenocarcinomas had diploid DNA content (2C) and 2 were hyperdiploid.

The synchronous populations were X-irradiated with a single dose of 10 Gy in the middle of the G1-phase, at the G1/S-transition or in the middle of the S-phase, respectively. The radiation effect was determined in 2 h intervals a) by 14C-TdR incorporation (IT) into the DNA, b) by autoradiography (AR), c) by flow cytometry (FCM). The incorporation rate decreased in all three cases, but the reasons appeared to be different, as can be derived from FCM and AR data: After irradiation in G1, a fraction of cells was prevented from entering S-phase, after irradiation at G1/S a proportion of cells was blocked in the S-phase, and after irradiation in S, DNA synthesis rate was reduced. As a consequence of these effects, the mean transition time through S-phase increased. The G2 blocks, obtained after irradiation at the three stages of the cycle were also different: Cells irradiated in G1 are partly released from the block after 10 h. Irradiation at G1/S caused a persisting accumulation of 50\% of the cells in G2, and for irradiation in S more than 80\% of the cells were arrested in G2.},

Synchronized L-929 cells were irradiated with 10 Gy of X-rays when progressing from B1- to S-phase of the cell cycle. In this study three methods to analyse DNA histograms were tested for applicability on FCM data obtained from cell populations blocked or retarded in the cycle: A) the Gaussian integral method, B) the peak-half-reflection method, and C) the rectangle method. Since histograms from synchronized cells are heavily distorted as compared to those obtained from exponentially growing cells and are quite similar to histograms from irradiated cells, they were used to test the suitability of the evaluation methods. Comparing the evaluated FCM data with the autoradiographic results from the same experimental series, the Gaussian integral method proved to be superior to the two other relatively simple approximation methods. The FCM histograms of irradiated cells were therefore analyzed only by the Gaussian integral method. It was shown that a considerable fraction of cells is still in the S-phase 25 h post irradiation, the DNA synthesis of which had ceased, as shown by autoradiography. This indicated that parallel measurements using FCM and autoradiography yield additional information on cell kinetic changes that cannot be obtained from applying one of the two methods used.},

There was a significant, though loose relationship between the cardiac volume and the endsystolic and enddiastolic volumes (r=0.73 and 0.55 respectively) and the ejection fraction (r=0.69) as determined by laevocardiography. The critical value of the cardiac size, about which one encounters an increased number of abnormal volume parameters, was the upper boundary of 1-SD. Using this value we found a specifity of 81\% and a sensitivity of 74\% for the heart volume as a predictor of a pathological ejection fraction. On the other hand, using the upper boundary of 2-SD as a critical value, there was a sensitivity of only 58\%, but a specificity of 92\%. Only 11\% of the patients with a cardiac size in the lower range of normal or below had an ejection fraction below 50\%. Therefore the radiologically determined heart size is a simple, in daily practive acceptable method to assess and follow up left ventricular function in coronary patients.},

	abstract = {The possible relationship between the cardiac volume, as determined radiologically in the supine position in 119 patients with angiographically proven coronary artery disease, and the results of ergometry and balloon catheterization was investigated. There was no relationship between the heart size on the one side and the maximum exercise tolerance and the maximum cardiac output on the other, except for the fact, that these parameters tended to decrease with increasing heart size. This was especially true in patients with angina. The maximum cardiac output of patients with angina was always below the value of patients without angina but comparable heart size. Reduced cardiac output under exercise (exertional cardiac insufficiency) was present in 50\% of patients with enlarged hearts but already in 22\% of patients with heart volumes in the lower range of normal. The diastolic pulmonary artery pressure, determined under exercise, was the only parameter with a significant relationship to the heart size: The larger the heart size, the higher the diastolic pulmonary artery pressure. On the other hand: the diastolic pulmonary artery pressure at rest was abnormal with significant frequency only, when the heart was enlarged. Our data suggest, that the hemodynamics are determined by 2 factors: Myocardial scarring secondary to infarction and coronary insufficiency (ischemia). Of these two factors only the former influences cardiac size. Therefore, determination of the heart volume helps evaluating the respective role of these two factors in individual cases.},

	abstract = {210 male patients with myocardial infarction, functional cardiovascular diseases, and angina pectoris hospitalized in the course of a cardiac rehabilitation program had been studied. Missing data in some anthropometric variables reduced the sample to 199 patients. The body of data included various anthropometric variables and indices, parameters of the circulatory and respiratory systems, biochemical measures, personality questionnaires, and information about the psychosocial background. In order to replicate the findings a sample of 100 students was studied, too. The measures and indices of body type are influenced by age, which leads to age-dependent spurious correlations between body type and other variables if this dependency is not corrected. Different statistical approaches proved the superiority of a factor-analytic typisation based on a "body-breadth" and "body-size" factor. There is a low correlation between body type and disposition for certain diseases showing that patients with "athletic" or "pycnic" body build suffer preferably from coronary infarction. Significant differences between body types exist for blood pressure, physical fitness, several psychosocial data, and the number of previous courses of treatment. Correlations of body type with personality dimensions and bodily complaints did not occur.},

It should be stressed that these positive effects can be demonstrated in the early stages of rehabilitation from infarction, that is, directly following discharge from the hospital, in the same way as in a late course of treatment of the repeated therapy; it is also important to point out that similar favorable results were obtained for older groups as for younger ones under all parameters, within the same time.

Compatibility with live animal experiments is confirmed by imaging the cerebral vasculature of an anesthetized mouse; a complete focal stack was obtained without any evidence of photodamage. As an additional validation of the utility of wide-field three-photon excitation, functional excitation is demonstrated by performing three-photon optogenetic stimulation of cultured mouse hippocampal neurons expressing a channelrhodopsin; action potentials could reliably be excited without causing photodamage.},

However, the lack of versatile and functional SWIR emitters has prevented the general adoption of SWIR imaging by the biomedical research community. Here, we introduce a class of high-quality SWIR-emissive indium-arsenide-based quantum dots (QDs) that are readily modifiable for various functional imaging applications, and that exhibit narrow and size-tunable emission and a dramatically higher emission quantum yield than previously described SWIR probes. To demonstrate the unprecedented combination of deep penetration, high spatial resolution, multicolor imaging and fast-acquisition-speed afforded by the SWIR QDs, we quantified, in mice, the metabolic turnover rates of lipoproteins in several organs simultaneously and in real time as well as heartbeat and breathing rates in awake and unrestrained animals, and generated detailed three-dimensional quantitative flow maps of the mouse brain vasculature.},

Measuring wavelength-dependent information in particular has a wide range of applications from cell and tissue refractometry to the cellular biophysical measurements. IM measurements at multiple wavelengths are typically associated with a loss in temporal resolution, field of view, stability, sensitivity, and may involve using expensive equipment such as tunable filters or spatial light modulators. Here, we present a novel and simple design for an interferometric microscope that provides single-shot off-axis interferometric measurements at two wavelengths by encoding the two spectral images at two orthogonal spatial frequencies that allows clean separation of information in the Fourier space with no resolution loss. We demonstrated accurate simultaneous quantification of polystyrene bead refractive indices at two wavelengths.},

In the present study, label-free profiling of skin fibroblasts exposed to time-bound ultra-violet radiation has been performed using quantitative phase imaging and Raman spectroscopy. Statistically significant differences in quantifiable biophysical parameters, such as matter density and cell dry mass, were observed with phase imaging. Accurate estimation of changes in the biochemical constituents, notably nucleic acids and proteins, was demonstrated through a combination of Raman spectroscopy and multivariate analysis of spectral patterns. Overall, the findings of this study demonstrate the promise of these non-perturbative optical modalities in accurately identifying cellular phenotypes and responses to external stimuli by combining molecular and biophysical information.},

A subset of individuals with NAFLD progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), an advanced form of NAFLD which predisposes individuals to cirrhosis, liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma. The current gold standard for NASH diagnosis and staging is based on histological evaluation, which is largely semi-quantitative and subjective. To address the need for an automated and objective approach to NASH detection, we combined Raman micro-spectroscopy and machine learning techniques to develop a classification model based on a well-established NASH mouse model, using spectrum pre-processing, biochemical component analysis (BCA) and logistic regression. By employing a selected pool of biochemical components, we identified biochemical changes specific to NASH and show that the classification model is capable of accurately detecting NASH (AUC=0.85-0.87) in mice. The unique biochemical fingerprint generated in this study may serve as a useful criterion to be leveraged for further validation in clinical samples.},

Besides dry mass, abundant cellular morphological features such as projected area, sphericity, and phase skewness can be readily extracted from the QPC interferometric data. To validate the utility of our technique, we demonstrate characterizing a large population of ∼10(4) HeLa cells.

The results demonstrate a lateral resolution improvement by a factor of three and providing 0.5 µm level axial optical sectioning.},

	abstract = {We review the mounting evidence that regeneration is induced in wounds in skin and peripheral nerves by a simple modification of the wound healing process. Here, the process of induced regeneration is compared to the other two well-known processes by which wounds close, i.e., contraction and scar formation. Direct evidence supports the hypothesis that the mechanical force of contraction (planar in skin wounds, circumferential in nerve wounds) is the driver guiding the orientation of assemblies of myofibroblasts (MFB) and collagen fibers during scar formation in untreated wounds. We conclude that scar formation depends critically on wound contraction and is, therefore, a healing process secondary to contraction. Wound contraction and regeneration did not coincide during healing in a number of experimental models of spontaneous (untreated) regeneration described in the literature. Furthermore, in other studies in which an efficient contraction-blocker, a collagen scaffold named dermis regeneration template (DRT), and variants of it, were grafted on skin wounds or peripheral nerve wounds, regeneration was systematically observed in the absence of contraction. We conclude that contraction and regeneration are mutually antagonistic processes. A dramatic change in the phenotype of MFB was observed when the contraction-blocking scaffold DRT was used to treat wounds in skin and peripheral nerves. The phenotype change was directly observed as drastic reduction in MFB density, dispersion of MFB assemblies and loss of alignment of the long MFB axes. These observations were explained by the evidence of a surface-biological interaction of MFB with the scaffold, specifically involving binding of MFB integrins α1 β1 and α2 β1 to ligands GFOGER and GLOGER naturally present on the surface of the collagen scaffold. In summary, we show that regeneration of wounded skin and peripheral nerves in the adult mammal can be induced simply by appropriate control of wound contraction, rather than of scar formation.},

	abstract = {We propose a novel common-path quantitative phase imaging (QPI) method based on a digital micromirror device (DMD). The DMD is placed in a plane conjugate to the objective back-aperture plane for the purpose of generating two plane waves that illuminate the sample. A pinhole is used in the detection arm to filter one of the beams after sample to create a reference beam. Additionally, a transmission-type liquid crystal device, placed at the objective back-aperture plane, eliminates the specular reflection noise arising from all the "off" state DMD micromirrors, which is common in all DMD-based illuminations. We have demonstrated high sensitivity QPI, which has a measured spatial and temporal noise of 4.92 nm and 2.16 nm, respectively. Experiments with calibrated polystyrene beads illustrate the desired phase measurement accuracy. In addition, we have measured the dynamic height maps of red blood cell membrane fluctuations, showing the efficacy of the proposed system for live cell imaging. Most importantly, the DMD grants the system convenience in varying the interference fringe period on the camera to easily satisfy the pixel sampling conditions. This feature also alleviates the pinhole alignment complexity. We envision that the proposed DMD-based common-path QPI system will allow for system miniaturization and automation for a broader adaption.},

Quantitative analysis of labile heme is of fundamental importance to understanding how nature preserves access to the diverse chemistry heme enables, while minimizing cellular damage caused by its redox activity. Here, we have developed and characterized a protein-based sensor that undergoes fluorescence quenching upon heme binding. By genetically encoding this sensor in the human malarial parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, we have quantified cytosolic labile heme levels in intact, blood-stage parasites. Our findings indicate that a labile heme pool (∼1.6 µM) is stably maintained throughout parasite development within red blood cells, even during a period coincident with extensive hemoglobin degradation by the parasite. We also find that the heme-binding antimalarial drug chloroquine specifically increases labile cytosolic heme, indicative of dysregulation of this homeostatic pool that may be a relevant component of the antimalarial activity of this compound class. We propose that use of this technology under various environmental perturbations in P. falciparum can yield quantitative insights into fundamental heme biology.},

	issn = {1600-0641},
	doi = {10.1016/j.jhep.2017.01.026},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: A wide range of liver diseases manifest as biliary obstruction, or cholestasis. However, the sequence of molecular events triggered as part of the early hepatocellular homeostatic response in obstructive cholestasis is poorly elucidated. Pericanalicular actin is known to accumulate during obstructive cholestasis. Therefore, we hypothesized that the pericanalicular actin cortex undergoes significant remodeling as a regulatory response to obstructive cholestasis.
METHODS: In vivo investigations were performed in a bile duct-ligated mouse model. Actomyosin contractility was assessed using sandwich-cultured rat hepatocytes transfected with various fluorescently labeled proteins and pharmacological inhibitors of actomyosin contractility.
RESULTS: Actomyosin contractility induces transient deformations along the canalicular membrane, a process we have termed inward blebbing. We show that these membrane intrusions are initiated by local ruptures in the pericanalicular actin cortex; and they typically retract following repair by actin polymerization and actomyosin contraction. However, above a certain osmotic pressure threshold, these inward blebs pinch away from the canalicular membrane into the hepatocyte cytoplasm as large vesicles (2-8μm). Importantly, we show that these vesicles aid in the regurgitation of bile from the bile canaliculi.
CONCLUSION: Actomyosin contractility induces the formation of bile-regurgitative vesicles, thus serving as an early homeostatic mechanism against increased biliary pressure during cholestasis.
LAY SUMMARY: Bile canaliculi expand and contract in response to the amount of secreted bile, and resistance from the surrounding actin bundles. Further expansion due to bile duct blockade leads to the formation of inward blebs, which carry away excess bile to prevent bile build up in the canaliculi.},

One difficulty of such strategies is segmenting the cell boundaries, which is a very different problem from segmenting color images from the real world. This paper addresses the difficulties and presents a superpixel-based framework for segmentation of regenerated muscle fibers in mice.
RESULTS: We propose to integrate an edge detector into a superpixel algorithm and customize the method for multi-channel images. The enhanced superpixel method outperforms the original and another advanced superpixel algorithm in terms of both boundary recall and under-segmentation error. Our framework was applied to cross-section and lateral section images of regenerated muscle fibers from confetti-fluorescent mice. Compared with "ground-truth" segmentations, our framework yielded median Dice similarity coefficients of 0.92 and higher.
CONCLUSION: Our segmentation framework is flexible and provides very good segmentations of multi-color muscle fibers. We anticipate our methods will be useful for segmenting a variety of tissues in confetti fluorecent mice and in mice with similar multi-color labels.},

Under high numerical aperture (NA) speckle-field illumination, our previous experiments have demonstrated less than 1 μm depth resolution in reflection-mode DSIM, while doubling the diffraction limited resolution as under structured illumination. However, there has not been a physical model to rigorously describe the speckle imaging process, in particular explaining the sectioning effect under high illumination and imaging NA settings in DSIM. In this paper, we develop such a model based on the diffraction tomography theory and the speckle statistics. Using this model, we calculate the system response function, which is used to further obtain the depth resolution limit in reflection-mode DSIM. Theoretically calculated depth resolution limit is in an excellent agreement with experiment results. We envision that our physical model will not only help in understanding the imaging process in DSIM, but also enable better designing such systems for depth-resolved measurements in biological cells and tissues.},

Developing in vitro assays that closely recapitulate the physiology of neuromuscular tissues is crucial to understand the formation and maturation of NMJs, as well as to help unravel the mechanisms leading to their degeneration and repair. We present a microfluidic platform designed to coculture myoblast-derived muscle strips and motor neurons differentiated from mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) within a three-dimensional (3D) hydrogel. The device geometry mimics the spinal cord-limb physical separation by compartmentalizing the two cell types, which also facilitates the observation of 3D neurite outgrowth and remote muscle innervation. Moreover, the use of compliant pillars as anchors for muscle strips provides a quantitative functional readout of force generation. Finally, photosensitizing the ESC provides a pool of source cells that can be differentiated into optically excitable motor neurons, allowing for spatiodynamic, versatile, and noninvasive in vitro control of the motor units.},

Previous studies suggest that only some of the tissues encountered during these procedures can be identified by spectroscopic methods, and no previous study has investigated the use of Raman, diffuse reflectance, and fluorescence spectroscopies. The authors hypothesized that real-time needle-tip spectroscopy may aid epidural needle placement and tested the ability of spectroscopy to distinguish each of the tissues in the path of neuraxial needles.
METHODS: For comparison of detection methods, the spectra of individual, dissected ex vivo paravertebral and neuraxial porcine tissues were collected using Raman spectroscopy (RS), diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, and fluorescence spectroscopy. Real-time spectral guidance was tested using a 2-mm inner-diameter fiber-optic probe-in-needle device. Raman spectra were collected during the needle's passage through intact paravertebral and neuraxial porcine tissue and analyzed afterward. The RS tissue signatures were verified as mapping to individual tissue layers using histochemical staining and widefield microscopy.
RESULTS: RS revealed a unique spectrum for all ex vivo paravertebral and neuraxial tissue layers; diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy were not distinct for all tissues. Moreover, when accounting for the expected order of tissues, real-time Raman spectra recorded during needle insertion also permitted identification of each paravertebral and neuraxial porcine tissue.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that RS can distinguish the tissues encountered during epidural needle insertion. This technology may prove useful during needle placement by providing evidence of its anatomical localization.},

We find that dynamic inhibitory synapses often disappear and reappear again in the same location. The starkest contrast between excitatory and inhibitory synapse dynamics is on dually innervated spines, where inhibitory synapses frequently recur while excitatory synapses are stable. Monocular deprivation, a model of sensory input-dependent plasticity, shortens inhibitory synapse lifetimes and lengthens intervals to recurrence, resulting in a new dynamic state with reduced inhibitory synaptic presence.

	abstract = {Biochemical gradients are ubiquitous in biology. At the tissue level, they dictate differentiation patterning or cell migration. Recapitulating in vitro the complexity of such concentration profiles with great spatial and dynamic control is crucial in order to understand the underlying mechanisms of biological phenomena. Here, a microfluidic design capable of generating diffusion-driven, simultaneous or sequential, orthogonal linear concentration gradients in a 3D cell-embedded scaffold is described. Formation and stability of the orthogonal gradients are demonstrated by computational and fluorescent dextran-based characterizations. Then, system utility is explored in two biological systems. First, stem cells are subjected to orthogonal gradients of morphogens in order to mimic the localized differentiation of motor neurons in the neural tube. Similarly to in vivo, motor neurons preferentially differentiate in regions of high concentration of retinoic acid and smoothened agonist (acting as sonic hedgehog), in a concentration-dependent fashion. Then, a rotating gradient is applied to HT1080 cancer cells and the change in migration direction is investigated as the cells adapt to a new chemical environment. The response time of ≈4 h is reported. These two examples demonstrate the versatility of this new design that can also prove useful in many applications including tissue engineering and drug screening.},

Previously demonstrated FPM systems are all based on partially-coherent illumination, which offers limited throughput due to insufficient brightness. Our FPM employs a high power coherent laser source to enable shot-noise limited high-speed imaging. For the first time, a digital micromirror device (DMD), imaged onto the back focal plane of the illumination objective, is used to generate spatially modulated sample illumination field for ptychography. By coding the on/off states of the micromirrors, the illumination plane wave angle can be varied at speeds more than 4 kHz. A set of intensity images, resulting from different oblique illuminations, are used to numerically reconstruct one high-resolution image without obvious laser speckle. Experiments were conducted using a USAF resolution target and a fiber sample, demonstrating high-resolution imaging capability of our system. We envision that our approach, if combined with a coded-aperture compressive-sensing algorithm, will further improve the imaging speed in DMD-based FPM systems.},

Despite the critical role of the insoluble matrix in cell regulation, there exist no widely-applicable methods for quantifying the chemical stimuli provided by a matrix to cells. Here, we describe a general-purpose technique for quantifying in situ the density of ligands for specific cell adhesion receptors of interest on the surface of a 3D matrix. This paper improves significantly the accuracy of the procedure introduced in a previous publication by detailed marker characterization, optimized staining, and improved data interpretation. The optimized methodology is utilized to quantify the ligands of integrins α 1 β 1, α 2 β 1 on two kinds of matched porous collagen scaffolds, which are shown to possess significantly different ligand density, and significantly different ability to induce peripheral nerve regeneration in vivo. Data support the hypothesis that cell adhesion regulates contractile cell phenotypes, recently shown to be inversely related to organ regeneration. The technique provides a standardized way to quantify the surface chemistry of 3D matrices, and a means for introducing matrix effects in quantitative biological models.},

In this report, we investigated whether non-linear optical imaging of the Glisson's capsule at liver surface would yield sufficient information to allow quantitative staging of liver fibrosis. In contrast to conventional tissue sections whereby tissues are cut perpendicular to the liver surface and interior information from the liver biopsy samples were used, we have established a capsule index based on significant parameters extracted from the second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy images of capsule collagen from anterior surface of rat livers. Thioacetamide (TAA) induced liver fibrosis animal models was used in this study. The capsule index is capable of differentiating different fibrosis stages, with area under receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) up to 0.91, making it possible to quantitatively stage liver fibrosis via liver surface imaging potentially with endomicroscopy.},

	abstract = {Multifocal multiphoton microscopy (MMM) improves imaging speed over a point scanning approach by parallelizing the excitation process. Early versions of MMM relied on imaging detectors to record emission signals from multiple foci simultaneously. For many turbid biological specimens, the scattering of emission photons results in blurred images and degrades the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We have recently demonstrated that a multianode photomultiplier tube (MAPMT) placed in a descanned configuration can effectively collect scattered emission photons from each focus into their corresponding anodes significantly improving image SNR for highly scattering specimens. Unfortunately, a descanned MMM has a longer detection path resulting in substantial emission photon loss. Optical design constraints in a descanned geometry further results in significant optical aberrations especially for large field-of-view (FOV), high NA objectives. Here, we introduce a non-descanned MMM based on MAPMT that substantially overcomes most of these drawbacks. We show that we improve signal efficiency up to fourfold with limited image SNR degradation due to scattered emission photons. The excitation foci can also be spaced wider to cover the full FOV of the objective with minimal aberrations. The performance of this system is demonstrated by imaging interneuron morphological structures deep in the brains of living mice.},

The high resolution Raman image showed the distributions of gold nanoparticles for their targeted sites such as cytoplasm, mitochondria, or nucleus. The high speed Raman-based live cell imaging allowed us to monitor rapidly changing cell morphologies during cell death induced by the addition of highly toxic KCN solution to cells.

In addition, the measured phase sensitivity of this method, which is the smallest measurable axial motion, is more than 40 times higher than that available using a transmission system. We demonstrate the utility of our method by successfully distinguishing the motion of the top surface from that of the bottom in red blood cells. The proposed method will be useful for studying membrane dynamics in complex eukaryotic cells.},

	abstract = {Multiphoton excitation fluorescence microscopy is the preferred method for in vivo deep tissue imaging. Many biological applications demand both high imaging speed and the ability to resolve multiple fluorophores. One of the successful methods to improve imaging speed in a highly turbid specimen is multifocal multiphoton microscopy (MMM) based on use of multi-anode photomultiplier tubes (MAPMT). This approach improves imaging speed by using multiple foci for parallelized excitation without sacrificing signal to noise ratio (SNR) due to the scattering of emission photons. In this work, we demonstrate that the MAPMT based MMM can be extended with spectral resolved imaging capability. Instead of generating multiple excitation foci in a 2D grid pattern, a linear array of foci is generated. This leaves one axis of the 2D MAPMT available for spectral dispersion and detection. The spectral-resolved MMM can detect several emission signals simultaneously with high imaging speed optimized for high-throughput, high-contents applications. The new procedure is illustrated using imaging data from the kidney, peripheral nerve regeneration and dendritic morphological data from the brain.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we present a strategy to improve delivery of femtosecond laser pulses from a regenerative amplifier through a hollow core photonic crystal fiber for temporally focused wide-field two-photon endomicroscopy. For endomicroscope application, wide-field two-photon excitation has the advantage of requiring no scanning in the distal end. However, wide-field two-photon excitation requires peak power that is 10(4)-10(5) times higher than the point scanning approach corresponding to femtosecond pulses with energy on the order of 1-10 μJ at the specimen plane. The transmission of these high energy pulses through a single mode fiber into the microendoscope is a significant challenge. Two approaches were pursued to partially overcome this limitation. First, a single high energy pulse is split into a train of pulses with energy below the fiber damage threshold better utilizing the available laser energy. Second, stretching the pulse width in time by introducing negative dispersion was shown to have the dual benefit of reducing fiber damage probability and compensating for the positive group velocity dispersion induced by the fiber. With these strategy applied, 11 fold increase in the two photon excitation signal has been demonstrated.},

Multiphoton microscopy offers several advantages over competing microscopy techniques: there is an inherent axial sectioning, penetration depths that compete well with confocal microscopy on account of the use of near-infrared light, and many two-photon contrast mechanisms, such as second-harmonic generation, have no analogue in one-photon microscopy. While the penetration depths of photons into tissue are typically limited on the order of hundreds of microns, this is of less concern in dermatology, as the skin is thin and readily accessible. As a result, multiphoton microscopy in dermatology has generated a great deal of interest, much of which is summarized here. The review covers the interaction of light and tissue, as well as the various considerations that must be made when designing an instrument. The state of multiphoton microscopy in imaging skin cancer and various other diseases is also discussed, along with the investigation of aging and regeneration phenomena, and finally, the use of multiphoton microscopy to analyze the transdermal transport of drugs, cosmetics and other agents is summarized. The review concludes with a look at potential future research directions, especially those that are necessary to push these techniques into widespread clinical acceptance.},

	abstract = {Homologous recombination (HR) is critical for the repair of double strand breaks and broken replication forks. Although HR is mostly error free, inherent or environmental conditions that either suppress or induce HR cause genomic instability. Despite its importance in carcinogenesis, due to limitations in our ability to detect HR in vivo, little is known about HR in mammalian tissues. Here, we describe a mouse model in which a direct repeat HR substrate is targeted to the ubiquitously expressed Rosa26 locus. In the Rosa26 Direct Repeat-GFP (RaDR-GFP) mice, HR between two truncated EGFP expression cassettes can yield a fluorescent signal. In-house image analysis software provides a rapid method for quantifying recombination events within intact tissues, and the frequency of recombinant cells can be evaluated by flow cytometry. A comparison among 11 tissues shows that the frequency of recombinant cells varies by more than two orders of magnitude among tissues, wherein HR in the brain is the lowest. Additionally, de novo recombination events accumulate with age in the colon, showing that this mouse model can be used to study the impact of chronic exposures on genomic stability. Exposure to N-methyl-N-nitrosourea, an alkylating agent similar to the cancer chemotherapeutic temozolomide, shows that the colon, liver and pancreas are susceptible to DNA damage-induced HR. Finally, histological analysis of the underlying cell types reveals that pancreatic acinar cells and liver hepatocytes undergo HR and also that HR can be specifically detected in colonic somatic stem cells. Taken together, the RaDR-GFP mouse model provides new understanding of how tissue and age impact susceptibility to HR, and enables future studies of genetic, environmental and physiological factors that modulate HR in mammals.},

The use of imaging detectors in MMM, such as CCD or CMOS, results in degradation of image signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) due to the scattering of emitted photons.

In this design, however, emission photons scattered to neighbor anodes are encoded by the foci scan location resulting in ghost images. The crosstalk between different anodes is currently measured a priori, which is cumbersome as it depends specimen properties. Here, we present the photon reassignment method for MMM, established based on the maximum likelihood (ML) estimation, for quantification of crosstalk between the anodes of MAPMT without a priori measurement. The method provides the reassignment of the photons generated by the ghost images to the original spatial location thus increases the SNR of the final reconstructed image.},

While image analysis of collagen in SHG images was consistently addressed until now, cellular and tissue information included in TPEF images, such as inflammatory and hepatic cell damage, equally important as collagen deposition imaged by SHG, remain poorly exploited to date. We address this situation by experimenting liver fibrosis quantification and scoring using a combined approach based on TPEF liver surface imaging on a Thioacetamide-induced rat model and a gradient based Bag-of-Features (BoF) image classification strategy.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: There is increasing need for accurate assessment of liver fibrosis/cirrhosis. We aimed to develop qFibrosis, a fully-automated assessment method combining quantification of histopathological architectural features, to address unmet needs in core biopsy evaluation of fibrosis in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients.
METHODS: qFibrosis was established as a combined index based on 87 parameters of architectural features. Images acquired from 25 Thioacetamide-treated rat samples and 162 CHB core biopsies were used to train and test qFibrosis and to demonstrate its reproducibility. qFibrosis scoring was analyzed employing Metavir and Ishak fibrosis staging as standard references, and collagen proportionate area (CPA) measurement for comparison.
RESULTS: qFibrosis faithfully and reliably recapitulates Metavir fibrosis scores, as it can identify differences between all stages in both animal samples (p{\textless}0.001) and human biopsies (p{\textless}0.05). It is robust to sampling size, allowing for discrimination of different stages in samples of different sizes (area under the curve (AUC): 0.93-0.99 for animal samples: 1-16 mm(2); AUC: 0.84-0.97 for biopsies: 10-44 mm in length). qFibrosis can significantly predict staging underestimation in suboptimal biopsies ({\textless}15 mm) and under- and over-scoring by different pathologists (p{\textless}0.001). qFibrosis can also differentiate between Ishak stages 5 and 6 (AUC: 0.73, p=0.008), suggesting the possibility of monitoring intra-stage cirrhosis changes. Best of all, qFibrosis demonstrates superior performance to CPA on all counts.
CONCLUSIONS: qFibrosis can improve fibrosis scoring accuracy and throughput, thus allowing for reproducible and reliable analysis of efficacies of anti-fibrotic therapies in clinical research and practice.},

	abstract = {Temporal focusing allows for optically sectioned wide-field microscopy. The optical sectioning arises because this method takes a pulsed input beam, stretches the pulses by diffracting off a grating, and focuses the stretched pulses such that only at the focal plane are the pulses re-compressed. This approach generates nonlinear optical processes at the focal plane and results in depth discrimination. Prior theoretical models of temporal focusing processes approximate the contributions of the different spectral components by their mean. This is valid for longer pulses that have narrower spectral bandwidth but results in a systematic deviation when broad spectrum, femtosecond pulses are used. Further, prior model takes the paraxial approximation but since these pulses are focused with high numerical aperture (NA) objectives, the effects of the vectorial nature of light should be considered. In this paper we present a paraxial and a vector theory of temporal focusing that takes into account the finite spread of the spectrum. Using paraxial theory we arrive at an analytical solution to the electric field at the focus for temporally focused wide-field two-photon (TF2p) microscopy as well as in the case of a spectrally chirped input beam. We find that using paraxial theory while accounting for the broad spectral spread gives results almost twice vector theory. Experiment results agree with predictions of the vector theory giving an axial full-width half maximum (FWHM) of 2.1 μmand1.8 μmrespectively as long as spectral spread is taken into account. Using our system parameters, the optical sectioning of the TF2p microscope is found to be 8 μm. The optical transfer function (OTF) of a TF2p microscope is also derived and is found to pass a significantly more limited band of axial frequencies than a point scanning two-photon (2p) microscope or a single photon (1p) confocal microscope.},

Targeted delivery of antifibrotic therapeutics to hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) might improve treatment outcomes and reduce adverse effects on healthy tissue. We delivered the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) gene specifically to activated hepatic stellate cells in fibrotic liver using vitamin A-coupled liposomes by retrograde intrabiliary infusion to bypass capillarized hepatic sinusoids. The antifibrotic effects of DsRed2-HGF vector encapsulated within vitamin A-coupled liposomes were validated by decreases in fibrotic markers in vitro. Fibrotic cultures transfected with the targeted transgene showed a significant decrease in fibrotic markers such as transforming growth factor-β1. In rats, dimethylnitrosamine-induced liver fibrosis is manifested by an increase in collagen deposition and severe defenestration of sinusoidal endothelial cells. The HSC-targeted transgene, administered via retrograde intrabiliary infusion in fibrotic rats, successfully reduced liver fibrosis markers alpha-smooth muscle actin and collagen, accompanied by an increase in the expression of DsRed2-HGF near the fibrotic foci. Thus, targeted delivery of HGF gene to hepatic stellate cells increased the transgene expression at the fibrotic foci and strongly enhanced its antifibrotic effects.},

The light sheet geometry, where the camera is oriented perpendicular to the sheet itself, provides an effective method of eliminating some of the scattered light and minimizing the sample exposure to radiation. However, residual background noise still remains, limiting the contrast and visibility of potentially interesting features in the samples. In this article, we investigate additional structuring of the illumination for improved background rejection, and propose a new technique, "3D HiLo" where we combine two HiLo images processed from orthogonal directions to improve the condition of the 3D reconstruction. We present a comparative study of conventional structured illumination based demodulation methods, namely 3Phase and HiLo with a newly implemented 3D HiLo approach and demonstrate that the latter yields superior signal-to-background ratio in both lateral and axial dimensions, while simultaneously suppressing image processing artifacts.},

While lifetime-resolved microscopy has long been in the repertoire of the biophotonics community, current implementations fall short in terms of simultaneously providing 3D resolution, high throughput, and good tissue penetration. This report describes a new highly efficient lifetime-resolved imaging method that combines temporal focusing wide-field multiphoton excitation and simultaneous acquisition of lifetime information in frequency domain using a nanosecond gated imager from a 3D-resolved plane. This approach is scalable allowing fast volumetric imaging limited only by the available laser peak power. The accuracy and performance of the proposed method is demonstrated in several imaging studies important for understanding peripheral nerve regeneration processes. Most importantly, the parallelism of this approach may enhance the imaging speed of long lifetime processes such as phosphorescence by several orders of magnitude.},

This dipole model is not sufficient to describe the effects of refractive index of a scatterer or to describe scattering at the edges of a scatterer. Taking into account the interaction between dipoles overcomes these short comings of the uncoupled dipole model. Coupled dipole model has been primarily used for linear scattering studies but it can be extended to predict nonlinear scattering.

	abstract = {Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) is a potent regulator of extracellular matrix production, wound healing, differentiation, and immune response, and is implicated in the progression of fibrotic diseases and cancer. Extracellular activation of TGF-β1 from its latent form provides spatiotemporal control over TGF-β1 signaling, but the current understanding of TGF-β1 activation does not emphasize cross talk between activators. Plasmin (PLS) and thrombospondin-1 (TSP1) have been studied individually as activators of TGF-β1, and in this work we used a systems-level approach with mathematical modeling and in vitro experiments to study the interplay between PLS and TSP1 in TGF-β1 activation. Simulations and steady-state analysis predicted a switch-like bistable transition between two levels of active TGF-β1, with an inverse correlation between PLS and TSP1. In particular, the model predicted that increasing PLS breaks a TSP1-TGF-β1 positive feedback loop and causes an unexpected net decrease in TGF-β1 activation. To test these predictions in vitro, we treated rat hepatocytes and hepatic stellate cells with PLS, which caused proteolytic cleavage of TSP1 and decreased activation of TGF-β1. The TGF-β1 activation levels showed a cooperative dose response, and a test of hysteresis in the cocultured cells validated that TGF-β1 activation is bistable. We conclude that switch-like behavior arises from natural competition between two distinct modes of TGF-β1 activation: a TSP1-mediated mode of high activation and a PLS-mediated mode of low activation. This switch suggests an explanation for the unexpected effects of the plasminogen activation system on TGF-β1 in fibrotic diseases in vivo, as well as novel prognostic and therapeutic approaches for diseases with TGF-β dysregulation.},

Here, we simultaneously monitor in vivo inhibitory synapse and dendritic spine dynamics across the entire dendritic arbor of pyramidal neurons in the adult mammalian cortex using large-volume, high-resolution dual-color two-photon microscopy. We find that inhibitory synapses on dendritic shafts and spines differ in their distribution across the arbor and in their remodeling kinetics during normal and altered sensory experience. Further, we find inhibitory synapse and dendritic spine remodeling to be spatially clustered and that clustering is influenced by sensory input.

Our observations suggest that porous collagen scaffolds enhance regeneration both in injured adult skin and peripheral nerves by disrupting the formation of a contractile cell capsule at the edges of the wound.

We further examined the effects of image segmentation and a priori constraints on the accuracy of lifetime extraction. Methods to test the applicability of global analysis on cellular data are proposed and demonstrated. The accuracy of global fitting degrades with lower photon count. By systematically tracking the effect of the minimum photon count on lifetime and FRET prefactors when carrying out global analysis, we demonstrate a correction procedure to recover the correct FRET parameters, allowing us to obtain protein interaction information even in dim cellular regions with photon counts as low as 100 per decay curve.},

METHODS: High-content analysis (HCA) was performed with 49 drugs on hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) LX-2 stained with 10 fibrotic markers. {\textasciitilde}0.3 billion feature values from all cells in {\textgreater}150,000 images were quantified to reflect the drug effects. A systematic literature search on the in vivo effects of all 49 drugs on hepatofibrotic rats yields 28 papers with histological scores. The in vivo and in vitro datasets were used to compute a single efficacy predictor (E(predict)).
RESULTS: We used in vivo data from one context (CCl(4) rats with drug treatments) to optimize the computation of E(predict). This optimized relationship was independently validated using in vivo data from two different contexts (treatment of DMN rats and prevention of CCl(4) induction). A linear in vitro-in vivo correlation was consistently observed in all the three contexts. We used E(predict) values to cluster drugs according to efficacy; and found that high-efficacy drugs tended to target proliferation, apoptosis and contractility of HSCs.
CONCLUSIONS: The E(predict) statistic, based on a prioritized combination of in vitro features, provides a better correlation between in vitro and in vivo drug response than any of the traditional in vitro markers considered.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: It is reported that cancer may arise in chronically inflamed tissue. There is mounting evidence suggesting that the connection between inflammation and lung cancer is not coincidental but may indeed be causal. The inflammatory molecules may be responsible for augmented macrophage recruitment, delayed neutrophil clearance and an increase in reactive oxygen species. The cytokines and growth factors unusually produced in chronic pulmonary disorders have been found to have harmful properties that pave the way for epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and tumor microenvironment. However, the role of inflammation in lung cancer is not yet fully understood.
AREAS COVERED: The role of chronic inflammation in the pathogenesis of lung cancer and some of the possible mechanisms involved, with particular focus on inflammatory mediators, genetic and epigenetic alterations, inflammatory markers, tumor microenvironment and anti-inflammatory drugs are discussed. A framework for understanding the connection between inflammation and lung cancer is provided, which may afford the opportunity to intercede in specific inflammatory damage mediating lung carcinogenesis and therapeutic resistance.
EXPERT OPINION: Advances in tumor immunology support the clinical implementation of immunotherapies for lung cancer. Along with therapeutic benefits, immunotherapy presents the challenges of drug-related toxicities. Gene modification of immunocytokine may lower the associated toxic effects.},

Phenazines have been challenging to study in vivo due to their redox activity, presence both intra- and extracellularly, and their diverse chemical properties. Here, we describe a noninvasive in vivo optical technique to monitor phenazine concentrations within bacterial cells using time-lapsed spectral multiphoton fluorescence microscopy. This technique enables simultaneous monitoring of multiple weakly fluorescent molecules (phenazines, siderophores, NAD(P)H) expressed by bacteria in culture. This work provides the first in vivo measurements of reduced phenazine concentration as well as the first description of the temporal dynamics of the phenazine-NAD(P)H redox system in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, illuminating an unanticipated role for 1-hydroxyphenazine. Similar approaches could be used to study the abundance and redox dynamics of a wide range of small molecules within bacteria, both as single cells and in communities.},

Here we present a structural mechanism for the role of inhibition in experience-dependent plasticity. Using chronic in vivo two-photon microscopy in the mouse neocortex, we show that experience drives structural remodeling of superficial layer 2/3 interneurons in an input- and circuit-specific manner, with up to 16\% of branch tips undergoing remodeling. Visual deprivation initially induces dendritic branch retractions, and this is accompanied by a loss of inhibitory inputs onto neighboring pyramidal cells. The resulting decrease in inhibitory tone, also achievable pharmacologically using the antidepressant fluoxetine, provides a permissive environment for further structural adaptation, including addition of new synapse-bearing branch tips. Our findings suggest that therapeutic approaches that reduce inhibition, when combined with an instructive stimulus, could facilitate restructuring of mature circuits impaired by damage or disease, improving function and perhaps enhancing cognitive abilities.},

In our study, we acquired the second-harmonic generation and two-photon excitation fluorescence microscopy images of liver tissues from bile duct-ligated rat model of liver fibrosis. We extracted morphology-based features, such as total collagen, collagen in bile duct areas, bile duct proliferation, and areas occupied by remnant hepatocytes, and defined the capsule and subcapsular regions on the liver surface based on image analysis of features. We discovered a strong correlation between the liver fibrosis progression on the anterior surface and interior in both liver lobes, where biopsy is typically obtained. The posterior surface exhibits less correlation with the rest of the liver.

With adaptive optics compensation, we demonstrate that the resolution and signal level can be better preserved at greater imaging depth in a variety of ex-vivo tissue specimens including mouse tongue muscle, heart muscle, and brain.

	abstract = {The three-dimensional matrix that surrounds cells is an important insoluble regulator of cell phenotypes. Examples of such insoluble surfaces are the extracellular matrix (ECM), ECM analogues and synthetic polymeric biomaterials. Cell-matrix interactions are mediated by cell adhesion receptors that bind to chemical entities (adhesion ligands) on the surface of the matrix. There are currently no established methods to obtain quantitative estimates of the density of adhesion ligands recognized by specific cell adhesion receptors. This article presents a new optical-based methodology for measuring ligands of adhesion receptors on three-dimensional matrices. The study also provides preliminary quantitative results for the density of adhesion ligands of integrins alpha(1)beta(1) and alpha(2)beta(1) on the surface of collagen-based scaffolds, similar to biomaterials that are used clinically to induce regeneration in injured skin and peripheral nerves. Preliminary estimates of the surface density of the ligands of these two major collagen-binding receptors are 5775 +/- 2064 ligands microm(-2) for ligands of alpha(1)beta(1) and 17 084 +/- 5353 ligands microm(-2) for ligands of alpha(2)beta(1). The proposed methodology can be used to quantify the surface chemistry of insoluble surfaces that possess biological activity, such as native tissue ECM and biomaterials, and therefore can be used in cell biology, biomaterials science and regenerative medical studies for quantitative description of a matrix and its effects on cells.},

The traditional method is time-consuming in that the specimen preparation procedure requires sample fixation, slicing, and labeling. Our goal is to apply multiphoton microscopy to efficiently image and quantitatively analyze liver fibrosis specimens bypassing steps required in histological preparation. In this work, the combined imaging modality of multiphoton autofluorescence (MAF) and second-harmonic generation (SHG) was used for the qualitative imaging of liver fibrosis of different METAVIR grades under label-free, ex vivo conditions. We found that while MAF is effective in identifying cellular architecture in the liver specimens, it is the spectrally distinct SHG signal that allows the characterization of the extent of fibrosis. We found that qualitative SHG imaging can be used for the effective identification of the associated features of liver fibrosis specimens graded METAVIR 0 to 4. In addition, we attempted to associate quantitative SHG signal to the different METAVIR grades and found that an objective determination of the extent of disease progression can be made. Our approach demonstrates the potential of using multiphoton imaging in rapid classification of ex vivo liver fibrosis in the clinical setting and investigation of liver fibrosis-associated physiopathology in animal models in vivo.},

We studied whether myofiber tract imaging performed with MR diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI) tractography has the capacity to resolve abnormalities of ventricular myoarchitecture in a model of congenital hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) associated with the ablation of myosin binding protein-C (MyBP-C). Homozygous MyBP-C knockout mice were generated by deletion of exons 3-10 from the endogenous MyBP-C gene. Fiber alignment in the left ventricular wall of wild type mice was depicted through DSI tractography (and confirmed by multi-slice two-photon microscopy) as a set of helical structures whose angles display a continuous transition from negative in the subepicardium to positive in the subendocardium. In contrast, the hearts obtained from the MyBP-C knockouts displayed substantial myoarchitectural disarray, characterized by a loss of voxel-to-voxel orientational coherence for fibers principally located in the mid-myocardium-subendocardium and impairment of the transmural progression of helix angles. These results substantiate the use of DSI tractography in determining myoarchitectural disarray in models of cardiomyopathy and suggest a biological association between myofilament expression, cardiac fiber alignment, and torsional rotation in the setting of congenital HCM.},

We confirm that epidermal growth factor (EGF)-family ligands are constitutively shed into the intercellular space and demonstrate that a step increase in compressive stress enhances EGF receptor (EGFR) phosphorylation with magnitude and onset kinetics closely matching those predicted by constant-rate ligand shedding in a slowly shrinking intercellular geometry. Despite the modest degree and slow nature of EGFR activation evoked by compressive stress, we find that the majority of transcriptomic responses to sustained mechanical loading require ongoing activity of this autocrine loop, indicating a dominant role for mechanotransduction through autocrine EGFR signaling in this context. A slow deformation response to a step increase in loading, accompanied by synchronous increases in ligand concentration and EGFR activation, provides one means for cells to mount a selective and context-appropriate response to a sustained change in mechanical environment.},

We find that the near-IR, reflected confocal (RC) signal is useful in characterizing refractive index varying boundaries in bovine cornea and porcine skin, while the multiphoton autofluorescence (MAF) and second-harmonic generation (SHG) intensities can be used to image cytoplasm and connective tissues (collagen), respectively. In addition, quantitative analysis shows that we are able to detect MAF from greater imaging depths than with the near-IR RC signal. Furthermore, by performing RC imaging at 488, 543, and 633 nm, we find that a longer wavelength leads to better image contrast for deeper imaging of the bovine cornea and porcine skin tissue.

After data acquisition, these sections are assembled using image-processing tools, and qualitative and quantitative information is extracted. By examining the reconstructed cardiac blocks, one can observe end-to-end adjacent cardiac myocytes (cardiac strands) changing cross-sectional geometries, merging and separating from other strands. Quantitatively, representative cross-sectional areas typically used for determining hypertrophy omit the three-dimensional component; we show that taking orientation into account can significantly alter the analysis. Using fast-Fourier transform analysis, we analyze the gross organization of cardiac strands in three dimensions. By characterizing cardiac structure in three dimensions, we are able to determine that the alpha crystallin mutation leads to hypertrophy with cross-sectional area increases, but not necessarily via changes in fiber orientation distribution.},

Due to the intrinsic limited sensitivity and operator-dependent variations, there exist high inter- and intraobserver discrepancies.

	doi = {10.1073/pnas.0903438106},
	abstract = {The ulcer-causing gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori is the only bacterium known to colonize the harsh acidic environment of the human stomach. H. pylori survives in acidic conditions by producing urease, which catalyzes hydrolysis of urea to yield ammonia thus elevating the pH of its environment. However, the manner in which H. pylori is able to swim through the viscoelastic mucus gel that coats the stomach wall remains poorly understood. Previous rheology studies on gastric mucin, the key viscoelastic component of gastric mucus, indicate that the rheology of this material is pH dependent, transitioning from a viscous solution at neutral pH to a gel in acidic conditions. Bulk rheology measurements on porcine gastric mucin (PGM) show that pH elevation by H. pylori induces a dramatic decrease in viscoelastic moduli. Microscopy studies of the motility of H. pylori in gastric mucin at acidic and neutral pH in the absence of urea show that the bacteria swim freely at high pH, and are strongly constrained at low pH. By using two-photon fluorescence microscopy to image the bacterial motility in an initially low pH mucin gel with urea present we show that the gain of translational motility by bacteria is directly correlated with a rise in pH indicated by 2',7'-Bis-(2-Carboxyethyl)-5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF), a pH sensitive fluorescent dye. This study indicates that the helicoidal-shaped H. pylori does not bore its way through the mucus gel like a screw through a cork as has previously been suggested, but instead achieves motility by altering the rheological properties of its environment.},

Net fiber alignment was represented for each method in terms of the local maxima of an orientational distribution function (ODF) derived from the local diffusion (DSI) and 3-D structural autocorrelation (TPM), respectively. Mesoscale myofiber tracts were generated by alignment of the principal orientation vectors of the ODFs. These data revealed a consistent relationship between the properties of the respective ODFs and the virtual superimposition of the distributed mesoscale myofiber tracts. The identification of a mesoscale anatomical construct, which specifically links the microscopic and macroscopic spatial scales, provides a method for relating the orientation and distribution of cells and subcellular components with overall tissue morphology, thus contributing to the development of multiscale methods for mechanical analysis.},

We show that remodeling interneurons are contained within a "dynamic zone" corresponding to a superficial strip of layers 2/3, and remodeling dendrites respect the lower border of this zone. Remodeling occurs primarily at the periphery of dendritic fields with addition and retraction of new branch tips. We further show that dendrite remodeling is not intrinsic to a specific interneuron class. These data suggest that interneuron remodeling is not a feature predetermined by genetic lineage, but rather, it is imposed by cortical laminar circuitry. Our findings are consistent with dynamic GABAergic modulation of feedforward and recurrent connections in response to top-down feedback and suggest a structural component to functional plasticity of supragranular neocortical laminae.},

However, the extension of this approach for high-throughput quantification of cellular morphological states has not been demonstrated. In this paper, we report the use of site-selective tissue image cytometry for the study of homologous recombination (HR) events during cell division in the pancreas of transgenic mice. Since HRs are rare events, recombinant cells distribute sparsely inside the organ. A detailed measurement throughout the whole tissue is thus not practical. Instead, the site selective two-photon tissue cytometer incorporates a low magnification, wide field, one-photon imaging subsystem that rapidly identifies regions of interest containing recombinant cell clusters. Subsequently, high-resolution three-dimensional assays based on two-photon microscopy can be performed only in these regions of interest. We further show that three-dimensional morphology extraction algorithms can be used to analyse the resultant high-resolution two-photon image stacks providing information not only on the frequency and the distribution of these recombinant cell clusters and their constituent cells, but also on their morphology.},

	abstract = {In order to visualize the effects of aqueous surfactant-humectant systems on the skin barrier, an in vitro two-photon fluorescence microscopy (TPM) study, including dual-channel visualization, was carried out. TPM is a non-invasive imaging technique based on two-photon induced nonlinear excitations of fluorophores, with the capability for deep-tissue imaging (up to several hundred micrometers). The following aqueous solutions of surfactants, a humectant, and a surfactant+humectant mixture that contacted pig full-thickness skin (p-FTS) were studied: (i) a harsh surfactant solution-sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) (1 wt\%); (ii) a harsh surfactant+humectant solution-SDS (1 wt\%) + glycerol (10 wt\%); (iii) a mild surfactant solution-sodium cocoyl isethionate (SCI) (1 wt\%); (iv) a control solution-phosphate-buffered saline (PBS); and (v) a humectant solution-glycerol (10 wt\%). Sulforhodamine B (SRB), a hydrophilic fluorescent probe, was used to visualize the effects of aqueous contacting solutions i-v on the skin barrier morphology. The results of the TPM visualization study revealed that SDS induces corneocyte damage by denaturing keratins and creating intracorneocyte penetration pathways. On the other hand, SDS+glycerol did not significantly induce corneocyte damage. The dual-channel TPM images corresponding to aqueous contacting solutions iii-v showed low SRB penetration into the corneocytes, as well as localization of the SRB probe within the lipid bilayers surrounding the corneocytes of the SC. Through a quantification of the amount of SRB that penetrated into the skin as a function of skin depth, we found that adding glycerol to an SDS aqueous contacting solution can significantly reduce the SDS-induced penetration depth of SRB, which provides evidence of the ability of glycerol to mitigate SDS-induced skin barrier perturbation. The distribution of SRB in the p-FTS samples was analyzed using a theoretical model that quantified changes in the skin aqueous pore characteristics induced by aqueous contacting solutions i, ii, iii, and v, relative to aqueous contacting solution iv, the control. The results of the theoretical model indicate the following ranking order in the extent of perturbation to the skin aqueous pores (from the highest to the lowest): i {\textgreater} ii {\textgreater} iii {\textgreater} iv {\textgreater} v. The development of such an in vitro visual ranking methodology, including quantification using TPM, can potentially reduce many costly in vivo screening procedures, thereby significantly reducing the cost and time-to-market of new cosmetic formulations containing surfactants and humectants.},

To understand the earliest stages of tumorigenesis, a method to identify and analyze clonal expansion is needed.

Here, we develop an integrated one- and two-photon imaging platform that spans four orders of magnitude to permit rapid quantification of clonal expansion in the FYDR pancreas in situ. Results show that as mice age there is a significant increase in the number of cells within fluorescent cell clusters, indicating that pancreatic cells can clonally expand with age. Importantly, {\textgreater}90\% of fluorescent cells in aged mice result from clonal expansion, rather than de novo sequence rearrangements at the FYDR locus. The spontaneous frequency of sequence rearrangements at the FYDR locus is on par with that of other classes of mutational events. Therefore, we conclude that clonal expansion is one of the most important mechanisms for increasing the burden of mutant cells in the mouse pancreas.},

In an earlier article, we described the design, development, and optimization phases of the FLTM before reporting its performances in a variety of viscoelastic materials. In the work presented here, we demonstrate the suitability of FLTM to study local cellular rheology and obtain values for the storage and loss moduli G'(omega) and G''(omega) of fibroblasts consistent with past literature. We further establish that chemically induced cytoskeletal disruption is accompanied by reduced cellular stiffness and viscosity. Next, we provide a systematic study of some experimental variables that may critically influence microrheology measurements. First, we interrogate and justify the relevance of bead endocytosis as a method of cellular internalization of 1-microm probes in FLTM. Second, we show that as sample temperature increases, FLTM findings are elevated toward higher frequencies. Third, we confirm that relevant bead sizes (1 and 2 microm) have no effect on FLTM measurements. Fourth, we report the lack of influence of bead coatings (antiintegrin, antitransferrin, antidystroglycan, or uncoated tracers were surveyed) on their rheological readouts. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of FLTM in studying how substratum rigidity regulates cellular rheological properties. Interestingly, multiple, coupled strain relaxation mechanisms can be observed separated by two plateau moduli. Although these observations can be partly explained by rheological theories describing entangled actin filaments, there is a clear need to extend existing microrheology models to the cytoskeleton, including potentially important factors such as network geometry and remodeling.},

In this report, we have used soft lithography to create morphologically polarized cells in order to examine rheological differences between the front and rear zone of an NIH 3T3 cell posed for migration. In addition, we trapped superparamagnetic beads with optical tweezers and precisely placed them at specific locations on the immobilized cells. The beads were then allowed to endocytose overnight before magnetic tweezers experiments were performed to measure the local rheological properties of the leading and trailing edges. Our results indicate that the leading edge has an approximately 1.9 times higher shear modulus than the trailing edge and that this increase in shear modulus correlates with a greater density of filamentous actin, as measured by phalloidin-staining observed through quantitative 3D microscopy.},

	abstract = {Interactions between the cell and the extracellular matrix regulate a variety of cellular properties and functions, including cellular rheology. In the present study of cellular adhesion, area was controlled by confining NIH 3T3 fibroblast cells to circular micropatterned islands of defined size. The shear moduli of cells adhering to islands of well defined geometry, as measured by magnetic microrheometry, was found to have a significantly lower variance than those of cells allowed to spread on unpatterned surfaces. We observe that the area of cellular adhesion influences shear modulus. Rheological measurements further indicate that cellular shear modulus is a biphasic function of cellular adhesion area with stiffness decreasing to a minimum value for intermediate areas of adhesion, and then increasing for cells on larger patterns. We propose a simple hypothesis: that the area of adhesion affects cellular rheological properties by regulating the structure of the actin cytoskeleton. To test this hypothesis, we quantified the volume fraction of polymerized actin in the cytosol by staining with fluorescent phalloidin and imaging using quantitative 3D microscopy. The polymerized actin volume fraction exhibited a similar biphasic dependence on adhesion area. Within the limits of our simplifying hypothesis, our experimental results permit an evaluation of the ability of established, micromechanical models to predict the cellular shear modulus based on polymerized actin volume fraction. We investigated the "tensegrity", "cellular-solids", and "biopolymer physics" models that have, respectively, a linear, quadratic, and 5/2 dependence on polymerized actin volume fraction. All three models predict that a biphasic trend in polymerized actin volume fraction as a function of adhesion area will result in a biphasic behavior in shear modulus. Our data favors a higher-order dependence on polymerized actin volume fraction. Increasingly better experimental agreement is observed for the tensegrity, the cellular solids, and the biopolymer models respectively. Alternatively if we postulate the existence of a critical actin volume fraction below which the shear modulus vanishes, the experimental data can be equivalently described by a model with an almost linear dependence on polymerized actin volume fraction; this observation supports a tensegrity model with a critical actin volume fraction.},

	abstract = {Image cytometry technology has been extended to 3D based on high-speed multiphoton microscopy. This technique allows in situ study of tissue specimens preserving important cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions. The imaging system was based on high-speed multiphoton microscopy (HSMPM) for 3D deep tissue imaging with minimal photodamage. Using appropriate fluorescent labels and a specimen translation stage, we could quantify cellular and biochemical states of tissues in a high throughput manner. This approach could assay tissue structures with subcellular resolution down to a few hundred micrometers deep. Its throughput could be quantified by the rate of volume imaging: 1.45 mm(3)/h with high resolution. For a tissue containing tightly packed, stratified cellular layers, this rate corresponded to sampling about 200 cells/s. We characterized the performance of 3D tissue cytometer by quantifying rare cell populations in 2D and 3D specimens in vitro. The measured population ratios, which were obtained by image analysis, agreed well with the expected ratios down to the ratio of 1/10(5). This technology was also applied to the detection of rare skin structures based on endogenous fluorophores. Sebaceous glands and a cell cluster at the base of a hair follicle were identified. Finally, the 3D tissue cytometer was applied to detect rare cells that had undergone homologous mitotic recombination in a novel transgenic mouse model, where recombination events could result in the expression of enhanced yellow fluorescent protein in the cells. 3D tissue cytometry based on HSMPM demonstrated its screening capability with high sensitivity and showed the possibility of studying cellular and biochemical states in tissues in situ. This technique will significantly expand the scope of cytometric studies to the biomedical problems where spatial and chemical relationships between cells and their tissue environments are important.},

	abstract = {Multifocal multiphoton microscopy (MMM) enhances imaging speed by parallelization. It is not well understood why the imaging depth of MMM is significantly shorter than conventional single-focus multiphoton microscopy (SMM). In this report, we show that the need for spatially resolved detectors in MMM results in a system that is more sensitive to the scattering of emission photons with reduced imaging depth. For imaging depths down to twice the scattering mean free path length of emission photons (2xl (s) (em)), the emission point spread function (PSF(em)) is found to consist of a narrow, diffraction limited distribution from ballistic emission photons and a broad, relatively low amplitude distribution from scattered photons. Since the scattered photon distribution is approximately 100 times wider than that of the unscattered photons at 2xl (s) (em), image contrast and depth are degraded without compromising resolution. To overcome the imaging depth limitation of MMM, we present a new design that replaces CCD cameras with multi-anode photomultiplier tubes (MAPMTs) allowing more efficient collection of scattered emission photons. We demonstrate that MAPMT-based MMM has imaging depth comparable to SMM with equivalent sensitivity by imaging tissue phantoms, ex vivo human skin specimens based on endogenous fluorophores, and green fluorescent protein (GFP) expressing neurons in mouse brain slices.},

Lateral resolution improvement of up to a factor of 2 has been achieved using structured illumination. In a total internal reflection fluorescence microscope, an evanescence excitation field is formed as light is total internally reflected at an interface between a high and a low index medium. The {\textless}100 nm penetration depth of evanescence field ensures a thin excitation region resulting in low background fluorescence. We present even higher resolution wide-field biological imaging by use of standing wave total internal reflection fluorescence (SW-TIRF). Evanescent standing wave (SW) illumination is used to generate a sinusoidal high spatial frequency fringe pattern on specimen for lateral resolution enhancement. To prevent thermal drift of the SW, novel detection and estimation of the SW phase with real-time feedback control is devised for the stabilization and control of the fringe phase. SW-TIRF is a wide-field superresolution technique with resolution better than a fifth of emission wavelength or approximately 100 nm lateral resolution. We demonstrate the performance of the SW-TIRF microscopy using one- and two-directional SW illumination with a biological sample of cellular actin cytoskeleton of mouse fibroblast cells as well as single semiconductor nanocrystal molecules. The results confirm the superior resolution of SW-TIRF in addition to the merit of a high signal/background ratio from TIRF microscopy.},

Rats expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) in all liver cells were used for isolation of the SE-1-positive cells added to cocultures. By the 13th day of culture, EGFP-expressing cells had largely disappeared from 2D control cultures but exhibited moderate proliferation in 3D perfused cultures.

The broadband multiphoton fluorescence (435-700 nm) and second harmonic generation (SHG, 360-400 nm) signals were generated by the 760 nm output of a femtosecond titanium-sapphire laser.

The change in the collagen structure as reflected in its SHG image is observed at length scales from submicron to hundreds of microns. We observed that heating the tendon below the temperature of 54 degrees C does not produce any change in the averaged SHG intensity. At the heating temperature of 54 degrees C and above, we find that increasing the heating temperature and time leads to decreasing SHG intensity. As the tendon is heated above 54 degrees C, the regions where the SHG signal vanish and form a tiger-tail like pattern. In addition, a decrease in the SHG signal occurs uniformly throughout the tendon. By comparing the relative SHG intensities in small and large areas, we found that the denaturation process responsible for forming the tiger-tail like pattern occurs at a higher rate than the global denaturation process occurring throughout the tendon. We also measured the fibril spacing and found that it remains constant at 1.61 +/- 0.04 micron for all heating temperature and times. The constant fibril density shows that the global denaturation process occurs at a length scale smaller than the size of the fibril.

The OG488 dye is fixed at the 5(') end of one strand, and the TMR label position is allowed to vary along the complimentary strand. Since OG488 and TMR are FRET pairs, the FRET efficiency can be determined theoretically from the distance separating the two dyes of the double-stranded DNA molecules. Microscopic images are formed by imaging microcapillaries containing various mixtures of oligonucleotides labeled with the FRET fluorophore pair, only the donor, or only acceptor. Traditional two-channel intensity measurements are compared with spectrally resolved imaging and fluorescence lifetime imaging by calculating a FRET index.

	abstract = {A 3D single-particle-tracking (SPT) system was developed based on two-photon excitation fluorescence microscopy that can track the motion of particles in three dimensions over a range of 100 mum and with a bandwidth up to 30 Hz. We have implemented two different techniques employing feedback control. The first technique scans a small volume around a particle to build up a volumetric image that is then used to determine the particle's position. The second technique scans only a single plane but utilizes optical aberrations that have been introduced into the optical system that break the axial symmetry of the point spread function and serve as an indicator of the particle's axial position. We verified the performance of the instrument by tracking particles in well-characterized models systems. We then studied the 3D viscoelastic mechanical response of 293 kidney cells using the techniques. Force was applied to the cells, by using a magnetic manipulator, onto the paramagnetic spheres attached to the cell via cellular integrin receptors. The deformation of the cytoskeleton was monitored by following the motion of nearby attached fluorescent polystyrene spheres. We showed that planar stress produces strain in all three dimensions, demonstrating that the 3D motion of the cell is required to fully model cellular mechanical responses.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The purpose of this work was to demonstrate the use of the combined imaging modality of multiphoton autofluorescence and second-harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy in obtaining spectrally resolved morphologic features of the cornea, limbus, conjunctiva, and sclera in whole, ex vivo porcine eyes.
METHODS: The 780-nm output of a femtosecond, titanium-sapphire laser was used to induce broadband autofluorescence (435-700 nm) and SHG (390 nm) from various regions of the surface of ex vivo porcine eyes. A water-immersion objective was used for convenient imaging of the curved surface of the eye.
RESULTS: Multiphoton autofluorescence was useful in identifying cellular structures of the different domains of the ocular surface, and the SHG signal can be used to resolve collagen organization within the cornea stroma and sclera of ex vivo porcine eyes.
CONCLUSIONS: Multiphoton autofluorescence and SHG microscopy have been demonstrated to be an effective technique for resolving, respectively, the cellular and collagen structures within the ocular surface of ex vivo porcine eyes. SHG imaging resolved the difference in structural orientations between corneal and sclera collagen fibers. Specifically, the corneal collagen is organized in a depth-dependent fashion, whereas the scleral collagen is randomly packed. Because this technique does not require histologic preparation procedures, it has the potential to be applied for in vivo studies with minimal disturbance to the eye.},

To examine the extent of neuronal remodeling that occurs in the brain on a day-to-day basis, we used a multiphoton-based microscopy system for chronic in vivo imaging and reconstruction of entire neurons in the superficial layers of the rodent cerebral cortex. Here we show the first unambiguous evidence (to our knowledge) of dendrite growth and remodeling in adult neurons. Over a period of months, neurons could be seen extending and retracting existing branches, and in rare cases adding new branch tips. Neurons exhibiting dynamic arbor rearrangements were GABA-positive non-pyramidal interneurons, while pyramidal cells remained stable. These results are consistent with the idea that dendritic structural remodeling is a substrate for adult plasticity and they suggest that circuit rearrangement in the adult cortex is restricted by cell type-specific rules.},

Such problems can be overcome by means of molecular three-photon excitation (3PE) with infrared femtosecond light pulses since longer excitation wavelengths result in less Raleigh scattering, and the subfemtoliter (confocal-like) 3PE volume minimizes out-of-focus photobleaching, background generation, and inner filter effects. We demonstrate the general feasibility of 3PE for protein spectroscopy and illustrate the technique's excellent potential for high-throughput screening.

The system integrates a standard multiphoton fluorescence microscope, an optical grating spectrograph operating in the UV-Vis wavelength region, and a 16-anode photomultiplier tube (PMT). The major technical innovation is in the development of a multichannel photon counting card (mC-PhCC) for direct signal collection from multi-anode PMTs. The electronic design of the mC-PhCC employs a high-throughput, fully-parallel, single-photon counting scheme along with a high-speed electrical or fiber-optical link interface to the data acquisition computer. There is no electronic crosstalk among the detection channels of the mC-PhCC. The collected signal remains linear up to an incident photon rate of 10(8) counts per second. The high-speed data interface offers ample bandwidth for real-time readout: 2 MByte lambda-stacks composed of 16 spectral channels, 256 x 256 pixel image with 12-bit dynamic range can be transferred at 30 frames per second. The modular design of the mC-PhCC can be readily extended to accommodate PMTs of more anodes. Data acquisition from a 64-anode PMT has been verified. As a demonstration of system performance, spectrally resolved images of fluorescent latex spheres and ex-vivo human skin are reported.

The accuracy and efficiency required to capture the physics associated with such a complex transient problem are realized by the use of the finite element-flux corrected transport (FE-FCT) algorithm in two dimensions. The model has been employed for the prediction of DNA sample preconcentration and transport during electrophoresis in a double-T injector microdevice. To test its validity, the numerical results have been compared with the corresponding experimental data under similar conditions, and excellent agreement has been found. Finally, detailed results from a simulation of DNA sample preconcentration in electrophoretic microdevices are presented using as parameters the electric field strength and the other species concentrations. The effect of the Tris concentration on sample stacking is also investigated. These results demonstrate the great potential offered by the model for future optimization of such microchip devices with respect to significantly enhanced speed and resolution of sample separation.},

	abstract = {Two-photon excitation fluorescence microscopy allows in vivo high-resolution imaging of human skin structure and biochemistry with a penetration depth over 100 microm. The major damage mechanism during two-photon skin imaging is associated with the formation of cavitation at the epidermal-dermal junction, which results in thermal mechanical damage of the tissue. In this report, we verify that this damage mechanism is of thermal origin and is associated with one-photon absorption of infrared excitation light by melanin granules present in the epidermal-dermal junction. The thermal mechanical damage threshold for selected Caucasian skin specimens from a skin bank as a function of laser pulse energy and repetition rate has been determined. The experimentally established thermal mechanical damage threshold is consistent with a simple heat diffusion model for skin under femtosecond pulse laser illumination. Minimizing thermal mechanical damage is vital for the potential use of two-photon imaging in noninvasive optical biopsy of human skin in vivo. We describe a technique to mitigate specimen thermal mechanical damage based on the use of a laser pulse picker that reduces the laser repetition rate by selecting a fraction of pulses from a laser pulse train. Since the laser pulse picker decreases laser average power while maintaining laser pulse peak power, thermal mechanical damage can be minimized while two-photon fluorescence excitation efficiency is maximized.},

	abstract = {Viscoelastic models of cells often treat cells as homogeneous objects. However, studies have demonstrated that cellular properties are local and can change dramatically on the basis of the location probed. Because membrane receptors are linked in various ways to the intracellular space, with some receptors linking to the cytoskeleton and others diffusing freely without apparent linkages, the cellular physical response to mechanical stresses is expected to depend on the receptor engaged. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that cellular mechanical stiffness as measured via cytoskeletally linked receptors is greater than stiffness measured via receptors that are not cytoskeletally linked. We used a magnetic micromanipulator to apply linear stresses to magnetic beads attached to living cells via selected receptors. One of the receptor classes probed, the dystroglycan receptors, is linked to the cytoskeleton, while the other, the transferrin receptors, is not. Fibronectin-coated beads were used to test cellular mechanical properties of the cytoskeleton without membrane dependence by allowing the beads to endocytose. For epithelial cells, transferrin-dependent stiffness and endocytosed bead-dependent stiffness were similar, while dystroglycan-dependent stiffness was significantly lower. For smooth muscle cells, dystroglycan-dependent stiffness was similar to the endocytosed bead-dependent stiffness, while the transferrin-dependent stiffness was lower. The conclusion of this study is that the measured cellular stiffness is critically influenced by specific receptor linkage and by cell type and raises the intriguing possibility of the existence of separate cytoskeletal networks with distinct mechanical properties that link different classes of receptors.},

Several hypotheses have been advanced that link physical forces to intracellular signalling pathways, but in many cases the molecular mechanisms of mechanotransduction remain elusive. Here we find that compressive stress shrinks the lateral intercellular space surrounding epithelial cells, and triggers cellular signalling via autocrine binding of epidermal growth factor family ligands to the epidermal growth factor receptor. Mathematical analysis predicts that constant rate shedding of autocrine ligands into a collapsing lateral intercellular space leads to increased local ligand concentrations that are sufficient to account for the observed receptor signalling; direct experimental comparison of signalling stimulated by compressive stress versus exogenous soluble ligand supports this prediction. These findings establish a mechanism by which mechanotransduction arises from an autocrine ligand-receptor circuit operating in a dynamically regulated extracellular volume, not requiring induction of force-dependent biochemical processes within the cell or cell membrane.},

	abstract = {Multi-photon fluorescence microscopy (MPFM) is a powerful technique for imaging scattering, biological specimens in depth. In addition to the sectioning effect generated by the point-like excitation volume, the near-infrared wavelengths used for multi-photon excitation allow deeper penetration into optically turbid specimens. In physiological specimens, the optical properties such as the scattering coefficients and refractive indices are often heterogeneous. In these specimens, it is not clear which type of immersion objective can provide optimized images in-depth. In particular, in-depth dermatological imaging applications using MPFM requires such optimization to obtain qualitative and quantitative information from the skin specimens. In this work, we address this issue by comparing the performances of two common types of high numerical aperture (NA) objectives: water-immersion and oil-immersion. A high-quality water-immersion objective (Zeiss, 40 x C-Apochromat, NA 1.2) and a comparable oil-immersion objective (Zeiss, 40 x Fluar, NA 1.25) were used for in-depth imaging of autofuorescent excised human skin and sulforhodamine B treated human skin specimens. Our results show that in the epidermal layers, the two types of immersion objectives perform comparably. However, in the dermis, multi-photon imaging using the oil immersion objective results in stronger fluorescence detection. These observations are most likely due to the degraded point-spread-function (PSF) caused by refractive index mismatch between the epidermis and the dermis.},

In addition to Maria Göppert-Mayer's theoretical work, the invention of the laser has a key role in the development of two-photon microscopy. Nonlinear effects were previously observed in different frequency domains (low-frequency electric and magnetic fields and magnetization), but the high electric field strength afforded by lasers was necessary to demonstrate many nonlinear effects in the optical frequency range. In 1978, the first high-resolution nonlinear microscope with depth resolution was described by the Oxford group. Sheppard and Kompfner published a study in Applied Optics describing microscopic imaging based on second-harmonic generation. In their report, they further proposed that other nonlinear optical effects, such as two-photon fluorescence, could also be applied. However, the developments in the field of nonlinear optical stalled due to a lack of a suitable laser source. This obstacle was removed with the advent of femtosecond lasers in the 1980s. In 1990, the seminal study of Denk, Strickler, and Webb on two-photon laser scanning fluorescence microscopy was published in Science. Their paper clearly demonstrated the capability of two-photon excitation microscopy for biology, and it served to convince a wide audience of scientists of the potential capability of the technique.},

	abstract = {The application of high-speed two-photon fluorescence microscopy (HTPM) to examine transdermal transport processes has enabled the noninvasive visualization of permeant spatial distributions over a larger, more clinically relevant wide area of the skin. Earlier studies demonstrated that the transdermal fluorescent probe distribution over a 2 x 2 mm skin area was well represented by a significantly reduced sampling of the 400 microscale skin sites (100 x 100 microm) constituting the wide area. In the present study, the 400 microscale skin sites are considered individually, and the site-to-site variability in permeant distributions is used as a model to reflect the range in experimentally measured skin permeabilities resulting from the inherent stratum corneum structural heterogeneity. The correlation established between the permeant surface intensity and the corresponding permeant intensity gradient at each skin site provides an indication of the potential for screening transdermal permeant distributions solely based on the evaluation of microscale permeant surface intensities. The strong linear correlation between the intensity gradient and the surface intensity for the hydrophilic model permeant, sulforhodamine B, demonstrated that surface intensities provide a robust indicator of the corresponding transdermal probe distributions at the microscale. For the hydrophobic model permeant, rhodamine B hexyl ester, however, weak correlations were observed between these two parameters. This result suggests that the stratum corneum microscale surface intensity does not validly capture the corresponding intensity gradients for the entire range of skin permeabilities typically encountered as a result of the inherent stratum corneum heterogeneity.},

	abstract = {The ability to determine various functions of genes in an intact host will be an important advance in the postgenomic era. Intravital imaging of gene regulation and the physiological effect of the gene products can play a powerful role in this pursuit. Intravital epifluorescence microscopy has provided powerful insight into gene expression, tissue pH, tissue pO2, angiogenesis, blood vessel permeability, leukocyte-endothelial (L-E) interaction, molecular diffusion, convection and binding, and barriers to the delivery of molecular and cellular medicine. Multiphoton laser scanning microscopy (MPLSM) has recently been applied in vivo to overcome three drawbacks associated with traditional epifluorescence microscopy: (i) limited depth of imaging due to scattering of excitation and emission light; (ii) projection of three-dimensional structures onto a two-dimensional plane; and (iii) phototoxicity. Here, we use MPLSM for the first time to obtain high-resolution images of deep tissue lymphatic vessels and show an increased accuracy in quantifying lymphatic size. We also demonstrate the use of MPLSM to perform accurate calculations of the volume density of angiogenic vessels and discuss how this technique may be used to assess the potential of antiangiogenic treatments. Finally, high-speed MPLSM, applied for the first time in vivo, is used to compare L-E interactions in normal tissue and a rhabdomyosarcoma tumor. Our work demonstrates the potential of MPLSM to noninvasively monitor physiology and pathophysiology both at the tissue and cellular level. Future applications will include the use of MPLSM in combination with fluorescent reporters to give novel insight into the regulation and function of genes.},

Among its advantages is the enhanced depth penetration permitted by fluorescence excitation with the near-infrared photons, which is particularly attractive for deep-tissue imaging. To fully utilize two-photon fluorescence microscopy as a three-dimensional research technique in biology and medicine, it is important to characterize the two-photon imaging parameters in a turbid medium. We investigated the two-photon point spread functions (PSFs) in a number of scattering samples. Gel samples containing 0.1-microm fluorescent microspheres and Liposyn III were used as phantoms mimicking the turbid environment often found in tissue. A full characterization of the two-photon PSFs of a water and oil immersion objective was completed in samples composed of 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 2\% Liposyn III. Our results show that up to depths of about 100 (oil) and 200 microm (water), the presence of scatterers (up to 2\% Liposyn III) does not appreciably degrade the PSF widths of the objectives.},

The dual channels enable the detection of the fluorescence emission wavelengths characteristic of the endogenous (intrinsic) skin fluorophores, as well as of the rhodamine-based model drug intensity emission at a different wavelength range of the fluorescence emission spectrum. These fluorescent model drugs delineate the oleic acid induced changes in permeant diffusion with respect to the skin structural features over the 0.3 mm by 0.3 mm skin area imaged per skin sample. The dual-channel high-speed two-photon fluorescence microscopy studies presented here provide evidence for the existence of intracorneocyte diffusion in addition to the commonly cited lipid multilamellar transdermal pathway. The image quantification analysis methodology introduced in this paper reveals that intracorneocyte diffusion exists for the hydrophobic (rhodamine B hexyl ester) and for the hydrophilic (sulforhodamine B) model drugs, in the absence of oleic acid chemical enhancer action. The mechanism of oleic acid chemical enhancer action, however, depends on the model drug physicochemical properties, where the oleic acid induces hydrophobic model drug localization to the lipid multilamellar region, while increasing the hydrophilic model drug lipid to corneocyte partitioning.},

This necessitates the use of force transducers that can apply precisely controlled forces to cells while monitoring the responses noninvasively. This paper describes the development of a micromanipulation workstation integrating two-photon, three-dimensional imaging with a high-force, uniform-gradient magnetic manipulator. The uniform-gradient magnetic field applies nearly uniform forces to a large cell population, permitting statistical quantification of select molecular responses to mechanical stresses. The magnetic transducer design is capable of exerting over 200 pN of force on 4.5-microm-diameter paramagnetic particles and over 800 pN on 5.0-microm ferromagnetic particles. These forces vary within +/-10\% over an area 500 x 500 microm2. The compatibility with the use of high numerical aperture (approximately 1.0) objectives is an integral part of the workstation design allowing submicron-resolution, three-dimensional, two-photon imaging. Three-dimensional analyses of cellular deformation under localized mechanical strain are reported. These measurements indicate that the response of cells to large focal stresses may contain three-dimensional global deformations and show the suitability of this workstation to further studying cellular response to mechanical stresses.},

	abstract = {The ndh genes encoding for the subunits of NAD(P)H dehydrogenase complex represent the largest family of plastid genes without a clearly defined function. Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) plastid transformants were produced in which the ndhB gene was inactivated by replacing it with a mutant version possessing translational stops in the coding region. Western-blot analysis indicated that no functional NAD(P)H dehydrogenase complex can be assembled in the plastid transformants. Chlorophyll fluorescence measurements showed that dark reduction of the plastoquinone pool by stromal reductants was impaired in ndhB-inactivated plants. Both the phenotype and photosynthetic performance of the plastid transformants was completely normal under favorable conditions. However, an enhanced growth retardation of ndhB-inactivated plants was revealed under humidity stress conditions causing a moderate decline in photosynthesis via stomatal closure. This distinctive phenotype was mimicked under normal humidity by spraying plants with abscisic acid. Measurements of CO(2) fixation demonstrated an enhanced decline in photosynthesis in the mutant plants under humidity stress, which could be restored to wild-type levels by elevating the external CO(2) concentration. These results suggest that the plastid NAD(P)H:plastoquinone oxidoreductase in tobacco performs a significant physiological role by facilitating photosynthesis at moderate CO(2) limitation.},

The use of the incompletely homologous (homeologous) Solanum plastid DNA as donor resulted in a Nicotiana plastid transformation frequency comparable with that of other experiments where completely homologous plastid DNA was introduced. Physical mapping and nucleotide sequence analysis of the targeted plastid DNA region in the transformants demonstrated efficient site-specific integration of the 7.8-kb Solanum plastid DNA and the exclusion of the vector DNA. The integration of the cloned Solanum plastid DNA into the Nicotiana plastid genome involved multiple recombination events as revealed by the presence of discontinuous tracts of Solanum-specific sequences that were interspersed between Nicotiana-specific markers. Marked position effects resulted in very frequent cointegration of the nonselected peripheral donor markers located adjacent to the vector DNA. Data presented here on the efficiency and features of homeologous plastid DNA recombination are consistent with the existence of an active RecA-mediated, but a diminished mismatch, recombination/repair system in higher-plant plastids.},

MDCK cells were transfected for coexpression of Teal-N-WASP/Venus-IQGAP1/mRFP1-Rac1, Teal-N-WASP/Venus-IQGAP1/mRFP1-Cdc42, CFP-Rac1/Venus-IQGAP1/mCherry-actin, or CFP-Cdc42/Venus-IQGAP1/mCherry-actin, and with single-label equivalents for spectral bleedthrough correction. Using confirmed E\% as an entry point, fluorescence levels and related ratios were correlated at discrete accumulating levels at cell peripheries. Rising ratios of CFP-Rac1:Venus-IQGAP1 were correlated with lower overall actin fluorescence, whereas the CFP-Cdc42:Venus-IQGAP1 ratio correlated with increased actin fluorescence at low ratios, but was neutral at higher ratios. The new FRET analyses also indicated that rising levels of mRFP1-Cdc42 or mRFP1-Rac1, respectively, promoted or suppressed the association of Teal-N-WASP with Venus-IQGAP1. These 3-color FRET assays further support our in vitro results about the role of IQGAP1, Rac1, and Cdc42 in actin nucleation, and the differential impact of Rac1 and Cdc42 on the association of N-WASP with IQGAP1.

Here we report the use of purified proteins for in vitro binding and actin polymerization assays, and Förster (or fluorescence) resonance energy transfer (FRET) microscopy of cultured cells to illuminate functional interactions among IQGAP1, N-WASP, actin, and either Cdc42 or Rac1. In pyrene-actin assembly assays containing N-WASP and Arp2/3 complex, IQGAP1 plus either small G protein cooperatively stimulated actin filament nucleation by reducing the lag time before 50\% maximum actin polymerization was reached. Similarly, Cdc42 and Rac1 modulated the binding of IQGAP1 to N-WASP in a dose-dependent manner, with Cdc42 enhancing the interaction and Rac1 reducing the interaction. These in vitro reconstitution results suggested that IQGAP1 interacts by similar, yet distinct mechanisms with Cdc42 versus Rac1 to regulate actin filament assembly through N-WASP in vivo. The physiological relevance of these multi-protein interactions was substantiated by 3-color FRET microscopy of live MDCK cells expressing various combinations of fluorescent N-WASP, IQGAP1, Cdc42, Rac1, and actin.

We describe calibration of both FLIM systems, and demonstrate how they are used to measure the quenched donor fluorescence lifetime that results from Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET). We then show how the FLIM-FRET methods are used to detect the dimerization of the transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-α in live mouse pituitary cell nuclei. Notably, the factors required for accurate determination and reproducibility of lifetime measurements are described.

	abstract = {FRET technologies are now routinely used to establish the spatial relationships between two cellular components (A and B). Adding a third target component (C) increases the complexity of the analysis between interactions AB/BC/AC. Here, we describe a novel method for analyzing a three-color (ABC) FRET system called three-color spectral FRET (3sFRET) microscopy, which is fully corrected for spectral bleedthrough. The approach quantifies FRET signals and calculates the apparent energy transfer efficiencies (Es). The method was validated by measurement of a genetic (FRET standard) construct consisting of three different fluorescent proteins (FPs), mTFP, mVenus, and tdTomato, linked sequentially to one another. In addition, three 2-FP reference constructs, tethered in the same way as the 3-FP construct, were used to characterize the energy transfer pathways. Fluorescence lifetime measurements were employed to compare the relative relationships between the FPs in cells producing the 3-FP and 2-FP fusion proteins. The 3sFRET microscopy method was then applied to study the interactions of the dimeric transcription factor C/EBPalpha (expressing mTFP or mVenus) with the heterochromatin protein 1alpha (HP1alpha, expressing tdTomato) in live-mouse pituitary cells. We show how the 3sFRET microscopy method represents a promising live-cell imaging technique to monitor the interactions between three labeled cellular components.},

In this article we describe the system development for the image acquisition for one- and two-photon excitation FRET microscopy. We also describe the precision FRET (PFRET) data analysis algorithm that we developed to remove spectral bleed-through and variation in the fluorophore expression level (or concentration) for the donor and acceptor molecules. The acquired images have been processed using a PFRET algorithm to calculate the energy transfer efficiency and the distance between donor and acceptor molecules. We implemented the software correction to study the organization of the apical endosome in epithelial polarized MDCK cells and dimerization of the CAATT/enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha).

Essentially, only the above three parameters D, A and D:A vs. E\% are the basis for these deductions. 3-color FRET uses the same basic parameters, but exponentially expands the opportunities to quantify interrelationships among 3 cellular components. We investigated a number of questions based on the results of a triple combination (F1-F2-F3) of TFP-NWASP/Venus-IQGAP1/mCherry-Actin - all involved in the nucleation of actin - to apply the extensive analysis assay possible with 3-color FRET. How do changing N-WASP or IQGAP1 fluorescence levels affect actin fluorescence? What is the effect on E\% of NWASP-actin by IQGAP1 or E\% of IQGAP1-actin by N-WASP? These and other questions are explored in the context of all proteins of interest being in FRET distance vs. any two in the absence of the third. 4 cases are compared based on bleed-through corrected FRET: (1) all 3 interact, (2) only F1-F3 and F2-F3 [not F1-F2], (3) only F1-F2 and F2-F3 interact [not F1-F3], (4) only F1-F2 and F1-F3 interact [not F2-F3]. Other than describing the methodology in detail, several biologically relevant results are presented showing how E\% (i.e. distance), fluorescence levels and ratios are affected in each of the cases. These correlations can only be observed in a 3-fluorophore combination. 3-color FRET will greatly expand the investigative range of quantitative analysis for the life-science researcher.},

Emission filters with wider bandwidth allow for an increased FRET signal and corresponding spillover. Treatment with the PFRET correction algorithm results in increasing correction levels and comparable energy transfer efficiency (E\%) values, thus validating our algorithm-based approach. The relationship between E\% and acceptor and donor levels and donor:acceptor (D:A) ratio is used to characterize the distribution of receptor-ligand complexes in endocytic membranes. In addition to the standard test for clustering (E\%'s independence from acceptor levels), we describe a second parameter: the negative dependence of E\% on increasing donor levels and D:A ratio. A donor geometric exclusion hypothesis is proposed to explain this phenomenon. One- and two-photon FRET microscopy assays show that polymeric IgA-receptor-ligand complexes are organized in clusters within apical endocytic membranes of polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney cells.},

Combining his quantitative approach of (Förster) resonance energy transfer (FRET) with state-of-the-art digital imaging techniques allows scientists to breach the resolution limits of light (ca. 200 nm) in light microscopy. The ability to deduce molecular or particle distances within a range of 1-10 nm in real time and to prove or disprove interactions between two or more components is of vital interest to researchers in many branches of science. While Förster's groundbreaking theory was published in the 1940s, the availability of suitable fluorophores, instruments, and analytical tools spawned numerous experiments in the last 20 years, as demonstrated by the exponential increase in publications. These cover basic investigation of cellular processes and the ability to investigate them when they go awry in pathological states, the dynamics involved in genetics, and following events in environmental sciences and methods in drug screening. This review covers the essentials of Theodor Förster's theory, describes the elements for successful implementation of FRET microscopy, the challenges and how to overcome them, and a leading-edge example of how Förster's scientific impact is still evolving in many directions. While this review cannot possibly do justice to the burgeoning field of FRET microscopy, a few interesting applications such as threecolor FRET, which greatly expands the opportunities for investigating interactions of cellular components compared with the traditional two-color method, are described, and an extensive list of references is provided for the interested reader to access.},

The models are tailored to extended clusters, which may be tightly packed, and account for geometric exclusion effects between membrane-bound proteins. Two main criteria are used to show that labeled polymeric IgA-ligand-receptor complexes are organized in clusters within apical endocytic membranes of polarized MDCK cells: 1), energy transfer efficiency (E\%) levels are independent of acceptor levels; and 2), with increasing unquenched donor: acceptor ratio, E\% decreases. A quantitative analysis of cluster density indicates that a donor-labeled ligand-receptor complex should have 2.5-3 labeled complexes in its immediate neighborhood and that clustering may occur at a limited number of discrete membrane locations and/or require a specific protein that can be saturated.

We quantified the apparent FRET efficiency (E\%) of this construct, using sensitized spectral FRET microscopy on the Leica TCS SP5 X imaging system equipped with a white-light laser that allows choosing any excitation wavelength from 470 to 670 nm in 1-nm increments. The E\% obtained in sensitized spectral FRET microscopy was then confirmed with fluorescence lifetime measurements. Our results demonstrate that mKO2 and mTFP are good FRET partners given proper imaging setups. mTFP was optimally excited by the Argon 458 laser line, and the 540-nm wavelength excitation for mKO2 was chosen from the white-light laser.

	abstract = {Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) microscopy is a powerful tool used to identify molecular interactions in live or fixed cells using a non-radiative transfer of energy from a donor fluorophore in the excited state to an acceptor fluorophore in close proximity. FRET can be a very sensitive tool to study protein-protein and/or protein-nucleic acids interactions. RNA toxicity is implicated in a number of disorders; especially those associated with expanded repeat sequences, such as myotonic dystrophy. Myotonic dystrophy (DM1) is caused by a (CTG)n repeat expansion in the 3' UTR of the DMPK gene which results in nuclear retention of mutant DMPK transcripts in RNA foci. This results in toxic gain-of-function effects mediated through altered functions of RNA-binding proteins (e.g. MBNL1, hnRNPH, CUGBP1). In this study we demonstrate the potential of a new acceptor photobleaching assay to measure FRET (AP-FRET) between RNA and protein. We chose to focus on the interaction between MBNL1 and mutant DMPK mRNA in cells from DM1 patients due to the strong microscopic evidence of their co-localization. Using this technique we have direct evidence of intracellular interaction between MBNL1 and the DMPK RNA. Furthermore using the AP-FRET assay and MBNL1 mutants, we show that all four zinc-finger motifs in MBNL1 are crucial for MBNL1-RNA foci interactions. The data derived using this new assay provides compelling evidence for the interaction between RNA binding proteins and RNA foci, and mechanistic insights into MBNL1-RNA foci interaction demonstrating the power of AP-FRET in examining RNA-Protein interactions in DM1.},

	abstract = {The conjugation of anti-cancer drugs to endogenous ligands has proven to be an effective strategy to enhance their pharmacological selectivity and delivery towards neoplasic tissues. Since cell proliferation has a strong requirement for iron, cancer cells express high levels of transferrin receptors (TfnR), making its ligand, transferrin (Tfn), of great interest as a delivery agent for therapeutics. However, a critical gap exists in the ability to non-invasively determine whether drugs conjugated to Tfn are internalized into target cells in vivo. Due to the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, it remains unknown whether these Tfn-conjugated drugs are specifically internalized into cancer cells or are localized non-specifically as a result of a generalized accumulation of macromolecules near tumors. By exploiting the dimeric nature of the TfnR that binds two molecules of Tfn in close proximity, we utilized a Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) based technique that can discriminate bound and internalized Tfn from free, soluble Tfn. In order to non-invasively visualize intracellular amounts of Tfn in tumors through live animal tissues, we developed a novel near infrared (NIR) fluorescence lifetime FRET imaging technique that uses an active wide-field time gated illumination platform. In summary, we report that the NIR fluorescence lifetime FRET technique is capable of non-invasively detecting bound and internalized forms of Tfn in cancer cells and tumors within a live small animal model, and that our results are quantitatively consistent when compared to well-established intensity-based FRET microscopy methods used in in vitro experiments.},

	abstract = {The dynamic regulation of the cellular trafficking of human angiotensin (Ang) type 1 receptor (AT1R) is not well understood. Therefore, we investigated the cellular trafficking of AT1R-enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) (AT1R-EGFP) heterologously expressed in HEK293 cells by determining the change in donor lifetime (AT1R-EGFP) in the presence or absence of acceptor(s) using fluorescence lifetime imaging-fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) microscopy. The average lifetime of AT1R-EGFP in our donor-alone samples was ∼2.33 ns. The basal state lifetime was shortened slightly in the presence of Rab5 (2.01±0.10 ns) or Rab7 (2.11±0.11 ns) labeled with Alexa 555, as the acceptor fluorophore. A 5-min Ang II treatment markedly shortened the lifetime of AT1R-EGFP in the presence of Rab5-Alexa 555 (1.78±0.31 ns) but was affected minimally in the presence of Rab7-Alexa 555 (2.09±0.37 ns). A 30-min Ang II treatment further decreased the AT1R-EGFP lifetime in the presence of both Rab5- and Rab7-Alexa 555. Latrunculin A but not nocodazole pretreatment blocked the ability of Ang II to shorten the AT1R-EGFP lifetime. The occurrence of FRET between AT1R-EGFP (donor) and LAMP1-Alexa 555 (acceptor) with Ang II stimulation was impaired by photobleaching the acceptor. These studies demonstrate that Ang II-induced AT1R lysosomal degradation through its association with LAMP1 is regulated by Rab5/7 via mechanisms that are dependent on intact actin cytoskeletons.},

	abstract = {Hypertension is a multigenic disorder in which abnormal counterregulation between dopamine and Ang II plays a role. Recent studies suggest that this counterregulation results, at least in part, from regulation of the expression of both the antihypertensive dopamine 5 receptor (D5R) and the prohypertensive Ang II type 1 receptor (AT1R). In this report, we investigated the in vivo and in vitro interaction between these GPCRs. Disruption of the gene encoding D5R in mice increased both blood pressure and AT1R protein expression, and the increase in blood pressure was reversed by AT1R blockade. Activation of D5R increased the degradation of glycosylated AT1R in proteasomes in HEK cells and human renal proximal tubule cells heterologously and endogenously expressing human AT1R and D5R. Confocal microscopy, Förster/fluorescence resonance energy transfer microscopy, and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy revealed that activation of D5R initiated ubiquitination of the glycosylated AT1R at the plasma membrane. The regulated degradation of AT1R via a ubiquitin/proteasome pathway by activation of D5R provides what we believe to be a novel mechanism whereby blood pressure can be regulated by the interaction of 2 counterregulatory GPCRs. Our results therefore suggest that treatments for hypertension might be optimized by designing compounds that can target the AT1R and the D5R.},

Here, Cerulean and the newly developed monomeric Teal FP (mTFP) are compared as FRET donors for Venus using spectral and fluorescence lifetime measurements from living cells. The results demonstrate that when compared to Cerulean, mTFP has increased brightness, optimal excitation using the standard 458-nm laser line, increased photostability, and improved spectral overlap with Venus. In addition, the two-photon excitation and fluorescence lifetime characteristics are determined for mTFP. Together, these measurements indicate that mTFP is an excellent donor fluorophore for FRET studies, and that its use may improve the detection of interactions involving proteins that are difficult to express, or that need to be produced at low levels in cells.},

Using 5-wk-old male chicks, simultaneous iv injections of CRH and AVT were found to result in a greater than additive increase in plasma corticosterone levels compared with that obtained with individual administration of either peptide hormone. In order to investigate molecular mechanisms underlying this observation, the chicken CRH receptor (CRHR) and vasotocin VT2 receptor (VT2R) were fused to cyan and yellow fluorescent proteins and expressed in HeLa cells. The resulting CRHR and VT2R fusion proteins were expressed appropriately in the plasma membrane and were found to couple to downstream signal transduction pathways. Quantitative fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis was used to determine whether the CRHR and VT2R formed heterodimers. In the absence of CRH and AVT, the FRET efficiency was 15-18\%, and the distance between receptors was 5-6 nm. Treatment of the cells that expressed both cyan fluorescent protein-CRHR and yellow fluorescent protein-VT2R with CRH or AVT alone did not lead to a significant change in the FRET efficiency. However, simultaneous addition of these hormones increased the efficiency of the FRET signal and decreased the distance between the two receptors. In HeLa cells expressing both CRHR and VT2R, treatment with CRH and AVT resulted in a significant increase in cAMP production over that with CRH alone, indicating that heterodimer formation may enhance the ability of the CRHR to activate downstream signal transduction.},

In this article, we review techniques that allow us to visualize these protein interactions as they occur in living cells. The cloning of genes from marine organisms that encode fluorescent proteins provides a way to tag and monitor the intracellular behavior of expressed fusion proteins. The genetic engineering of jellyfish green fluorescent protein (GFP) and the recent cloning of a sea anemone red fluorescent protein (RFP) have provided fluorescent tags that emit light at wavelengths ranging from the blue to the red spectrum. Several of these color variants can be readily distinguished by fluorescence microscopy, allowing them to be used in combination to monitor the behavior of two or more independent proteins in the same living cell. We describe the use of this approach to examine where transcription factors are assembled in the nucleus. To demonstrate that these labeled nuclear proteins are interacting, however, requires spatial resolution that exceeds the optical limit of the light microscope. This degree of spatial resolution can be achieved with the conventional light microscope using the technique of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). The application of FRET microscopy to detect the interactions between proteins labeled with the color variants of GFP and the limitations of the FRET approach are discussed. The use of different-color fluorescent proteins in combination with FRET offers the opportunity to study the complex behavior of key regulatory proteins in their natural environment within the living cell.},

In the solid state CEAK gives a structured blue emission and CEA gives a broad structureless green emission. The differences in luminescence behavior are explained on the basis of crystal packing. X-ray analysis shows that every two adjacent anthracene moieties in CEA form a sandwich-like anti-parallel dimer; the green-structureless emission then arises from the pi-pi stack of the aromatic rings. In CEAK, disruption of the pi-pi stacking structure forces a large separation between the anthracene rings, which yields an anthracene monomer emission.

	abstract = {Traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains the most common cause of death in persons under age 45 in the Western world. One of the principal determinants of morbidity and mortality following TBI is traumatic axonal injury (TAI). Current hypotheses on the pathogenesis of TAI involve activation of apoptotic cascades secondary to TBI. While a number of studies have demonstrated direct evidence for the activation of apoptotic cascades in TAI, the precise pathway by which these cascades are initiated remains a subject of intense investigation. As axolemmal disruption with the subsequent intra-axonal influx of large molecular weight species has been demonstrated to occur in relation to local axonal breakdown, attention has focused on cascades that may occur as a result of loss of ionic homeostasis. One proposed pathway by which this has been hypothesized to occur is the Ca(2+)-mediated activation of calmodulin and subsequent activation of the phosphatase calcineurin with dephosphorylation of a protein known as BAD, leading to a proapoptotic interaction between BAD and the mitochondrial protein Bcl-xL. While this pathway is an intriguing route for traumatic axonal pathogenesis, neither conventional immunocytochemical/histochemical nor ultrastructural approaches have had the capacity to shed insight on whether BAD and Bcl-xL interact in TAI in vivo. We describe the implementation of confocal and two-photon excitation fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) microscopy techniques through which we demonstrate interaction between the proapoptotic protein BAD and the prosurvival protein Bcl-xL within TAI following TBI.

The current advances in fluorescence microscopy, coupled with the development of new fluorescent probes such as green fluorescent proteins, allow fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to be used to study protein interactions in living specimens. Intensity-based FRET microscopy is limited by spectral bleed-through and fluorophore concentration. Fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) microscopy and lifetime measurements are independent of change in fluorophore concentration or excitation intensity, and the combination of FRET and FLIM provides high spatial (nanometre) and temporal (nanoseconds) resolution. Because only the donor fluorophore lifetime is measured, spectral bleed-through is not an issue in FRET-FLIM imaging. In this paper we describe the development of a nanosecond FRET-FLIM microscopy instrumentation to acquire the time-resolved images of donor in the presence and the absence of the acceptor. Software was developed to process the acquired images for single and double exponential decays. Measurement of donor lifetime in two different conditions allowed us to calculate accurately the distance between the interacting proteins. We used this approach to quantify the dimerization of the transcription factor CAATT/enhancer binding protein alpha in living pituitary cells. The one- and two-component analysis of the donor molecule lifetime in the presence of acceptor demonstrates the distance distribution between interacting proteins.},

	abstract = {Interacting proteins assemble into molecular machines that control cellular homeostasis in living cells. While the in vitro screening methods have the advantage of providing direct access to the genetic information encoding unknown protein partners, they do not allow direct access to interactions of these protein partners in their natural environment inside the living cell. Using wide-field, confocal, or two-photon (2p) fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) microscopy, this information can be obtained from living cells and tissues with nanometer resolution. One of the important conditions for FRET to occur is the overlap of the emission spectrum of the donor with the absorption spectrum of the acceptor. As a result of spectral overlap, the FRET signal is always contaminated by donor emission into the acceptor channel and by the excitation of acceptor molecules by the donor excitation wavelength. Mathematical algorithms are required to correct the spectral bleed-through signal in wide-field, confocal, and two-photon FRET microscopy. In contrast, spectral bleed-through is not an issue in FRET/FLIM imaging because only the donor fluorophore lifetime is measured; also, fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) measurements are independent of excitation intensity or fluorophore concentration. The combination of FRET and FLIM provides high spatial (nanometer) and temporal (nanosecond) resolution when compared to intensity-based FRET imaging. In this paper, we describe various FRET microscopy techniques and its application to protein-protein interactions.},

In this study, we compare two-photon excitation with laser scanning confocal and conventional digital deconvolution fluorescence microscopy, using the same optical configuration, for their ability to resolve cell shape deep in Xenopus gastrula and neurula tissues. The two-photon microscope offers better depth penetration and less autofluorescence compared to confocal and conventional deconvolution imaging. Both two-photon excitation and confocal microscopy also provide improved rejection of "out-of-focus" noise and better lateral and axial resolution than conventional digital deconvolution microscopy. Deep Xenopus cells are best resolved by applying the digital deconvolution method on the two-photon images. We have also found that the two-photon has better depth penetration without any degradation in the image quality of interior sections compared to the other two techniques. Also, we have demonstrated that the quality of the image changes at different depths for various excitation powers.},

	doi = {10.1242/dev.030601},
	abstract = {Despite being implicated as a mechanism driving gastrulation and body axis elongation in mouse embryos, the cellular mechanisms underlying mammalian convergent extension (CE) are unknown. Here we show, with high-resolution time-lapse imaging of living mouse embryos, that mesodermal CE occurs by mediolateral cell intercalation, driven by mediolaterally polarized cell behavior. The initial events in the onset of CE are mediolateral elongation, alignment and orientation of mesoderm cells as they exit the primitive streak. This cell shape change occurs prior to, and is required for, the subsequent onset of mediolaterally polarized protrusive activity. In embryos mutant for PTK7, a novel cell polarity protein, the normal cell elongation and alignment upon leaving the primitive streak, the subsequent polarized protrusive activity, and CE and axial elongation all failed. The mesoderm normally thickens and extends, but on failure of convergence movements in Ptk7 mutants, the mesoderm underwent radial intercalation and excessive thinning, which suggests that a cryptic radial cell intercalation behavior resists excessive convergence-driven mesodermal thickening in normal embryos. When unimpeded by convergence forces in Ptk7 mutants, this unopposed radial intercalation resulted in excessive thinning of the mesoderm. These results show for the first time the polarized cell behaviors underlying CE in the mouse, demonstrate unique aspects of these behaviors compared with those of other vertebrates, and clearly define specific roles for planar polarity and for the novel planar cell polarity gene, Ptk7, as essential regulators of mediolateral cell intercalation during mammalian CE.},

These contaminations in the FRET signal can be corrected using a mathematical algorithm to extract the true FRET signal. Another approach is 2P-FRET fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM). This methodology allows studying the dynamic behavior of protein-protein interactions in living cells and tissues. 2P-FRET-FLIM was used to study the dimerization of the CAATT/enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha). Results show that the reduction in donor lifetime in the presence of acceptor reveals the dimerization of the protein molecules and also determines more precisely the distance between the donor and acceptor.

HPV sequences were labeled by FISH and the cells imaged using an epi-fluorescence microscope coupled to a low-light color CCD camera. Before application to clinical specimens, AFIC was assessed using fluorescent calibration beads and cervical cancer cell lines containing known numbers of integrated HPV genomes per nucleus. Assessment showed that our AFIC had a linear response, was quantitatively accurate, and had the sensitivity to detect one HPV genome per nucleus. After acquisition of images, computer algorithms identified every cell nucleus (via a fluorescent DNA counterstain) and quantified the FISH signal per nucleus. AFIC was employed to screen 27 patient specimens for HPV 16/18, of which 12 were positive. The HPV status of the specimens positively correlated with the pathological diagnosis, and since AFIC automatically and correctly located every cell, it was possible to directly compare morphology and HPV status in the same cell. In conclusion, the combination of FISH and AFIC is a sensitive and quantitative method to detect high risk HPV sequences in cervical smears.},

The entire procedure can be carried out in 4.5 hr through the elimination of some of the steps routinely used in other ISH protocols. We also compared the sensitivity of this new FISH method (Method 1) to four other FISH techniques: digoxigenin-labeled DNA probe (Method 2); fluorescein-15-d-ATP-labeled oligonucleotides (Method 3); fluorescein 15-d-ATP labeled DNA probe (Method 4); and biotin-DNA-labeled probe (Method 5), for their ability to detect HPV DNA in the HPV-positive human cervical cell lines CaSki (500 copies) and SiHa (1-5 copies), but not in C33-A and HT-3, which do not contain any copies of HPV. Our results indicate that Method 1 is more sensitive than the other methods employed. Method 1 was the only method that could reliably detect an HPV-16 genome in all SiHa cells. Our data suggest that the Method 1 FISH technique is highly sensitive and may therefore be of general use for detection and quantitation of a variety of viral genomes (including HIV), oncogenes, and drug-resistant genes, in a variety of morphologically intact cells and tissues.},

We previously observed that C/EBPalpha was concentrated in regions of centromeric heterochromatin in pituitary GHFT1-5 cells and that coexpressed Pit-1 redistributed C/EBPalpha to the subnuclear sites occupied by Pit-1. Here, we used fluorescence resonance energy transfer microscopy to show that when C/EBPalpha was recruited by Pit-1, the average distance separating the fluorophores labeling the proteins was less than 7 nm. A mutation in the Pit-1 homeodomain, or truncation of the C/EBPalpha transactivation domain disrupted the redistribution of C/EBPalpha by Pit-1. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis revealed that the mutant Pit-1 still associated with C/EBPalpha, and the truncated C/EBPalpha still associated with Pit-1, but these interactions were preferentially localized in regions of centromeric heterochromatin. In contrast, a truncation in C/EBPalpha that prevented DNA binding also blocked its association with Pit-1, suggesting that the binding of C/EBPalpha to DNA is a critical first step in specifying its association with Pit-1. These findings indicated that the protein domains that specify the interaction of Pit-1 and C/EBPalpha are separable from the protein domains that direct the positioning of the associated proteins within the nucleus. The intimate association of Pit-1 and C/EBPalpha at certain sites within the living cell nucleus could foster their combinatorial activities in the regulation of pituitary-specific gene expression.},

	abstract = {The cellular uptake and intracellular distribution of methylphosphonate oligonucleotides (15 mers) has been examined using both 32P labeled and fluorescent labeled oligonucleotides. The cellular uptake process for methylphosphonate oligonucleotides is highly temperature dependent, with a major increase in uptake occurring between 15 and 20 degrees C. Most of the label which becomes cell associated at 37 degrees C cannot be removed by acid washing or trypsinization and thus seems to be within the cell. Visualization of rhodamine labeled methylphosphonate oligonucleotides using digital imaging fluorescence microscopy reveals a vesicular subcellular distribution suggestive of an endosomal localization. There was extensive co-localization of rhodamine labeled methylphosphonate oligonucleotides with fluorescein-dextran, an endosomal/lysosomal marker substance. The apparent endocytotic uptake of labeled methylphosphonate oligonucleotides could not be blocked by competition with unlabeled methylphosphonate or phosphodiester oligonucleotides, nor by ATP. This contrasts with the situation for radiolabeled phosphodiester oligonucleotides whose uptake can be completely blocked with unlabeled competitor. Uptake of phosphodiester oligonucleotides, but not of methylphosphonate oligonucleotides, could be blocked by acidification of the cytosol. These observations suggest that the pathway of cellular uptake of methylphosphonate oligonucleotides involves fluid phase or adsorbtive endocytosis, and is distinct from the uptake pathway for phosphodiester oligonucleotides.},

Additionally, whole embryo culture mouse models have shown strain-related differences in sensitivity to ethanol-induced damage following acute exposure during early NCC development. That differential sensitivity of NCCs may contribute to these strain differences has been unexplored. For this purpose, cultured NCCs from an inbred mouse strain (C57BL/6J; C57) that is more sensitive to ethanol-induced teratogenicity than an outbred strain (ICR) were compared. This study showed that the incidence of cell death was significantly higher for the C57 NCCs than those from the ICR strain at all ethanol concentrations tested, and as early as 12 hours after initial exposure to 100 mM ethanol. The lateral mobility of the membrane lipids was faster and the membrane GM1 content was lower in C57 cells than ICR cells both under control conditions and at all doses and times tested. Ethanol exposure resulted in significant increases in the membrane lipid lateral mobility, and decreases in the membrane GM1 content that occurred in a dose and time-dependent manner in the NCCs from both strains. A significant correlation was found between the GM1 content and lateral mobility of the membrane lipids, the lateral mobility of membrane lipids and cell viability, as well as the GM1 content and cell viability in the NCCs from both strains. These results suggest that different strain sensitivities to ethanol-induced teratogencity may lie, at least in part, in the interstrain differential response of the NCC population and that the vulnerability of the NCCs to ethanol-induced death may be related to their endogenous membrane GM1 content.},

This study compares the effects of cyclosporin A and verapamil on doxorubicin resistance in chinese hamster ovary cells (CHRC5) using several criteria including in vitro cytotoxicity, drug accumulation, intracellular distribution by video microscopy, and nuclear DNA damage. Our results demonstrate that verapamil modulation of doxorubicin resistance was paralleled by cellular accumulation of doxorubicin, altered intracellular distribution of doxorubicin from cytoplasm to nucleus, and an increase in the formation of doxorubicin related DNA strand breaks. In contrast, the modulating effect of cyclosporin was qualitatively different. High concentrations of cyclosporin (5 micrograms/ml) increased doxorubicin accumulation and caused partial redistribution to the nucleus. However, with low concentrations of cyclosporin (1 microgram/ml) increased doxorubicin sensitivity was observed without changes in net accumulation of doxorubicin or intracellular distribution, and without enhanced doxorubicin induced DNA breakage. These results suggest that cyclosporin A can modulate doxorubicin cytotoxicity by means other than interference with the P-glycoprotein drug efflux system.},

It has been applied in luminescence microscopy and single-molecule lifetime evaluation. To date, the primary application has been in single-exponential evaluations. We present extensions of the method to double exponentials. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we assess the performance of both the double-exponential decay with known lifetimes and the double-exponential decay with unknown preexponential factors and lifetimes. Precision is evaluated as a function of the noise level (Poisson statistics), the ratios of the lifetimes, the ratios of their preexponential factors, and the fitting window. Optimum measurement conditions are determined. RLD is shown to work well over a wide range of practical experimental conditions. If the lifetimes are known, the preexponential factors can be determined with good precision even at low total counts (10(4)). With unknown preexponential factors and lifetimes, precisions decrease but are still acceptable. A new gating scheme (overlapped gating) is shown to offer improved precision for the case of a single-exponential decay. Theoretical predictions are tested against actual experimental data from a laser-based lifetime instrument.},

	abstract = {Angiotensin II type 2 (AT2R) or bradykinin B2 (B2R) receptor activation enhances NO production. Recently, we demonstrated enhancement of NO production when AT2R and B2R are simultaneously activated in vivo. However, the mechanism involved in this enhancement is unknown. Using confocal fluorescence resonance energy transfer microscopy, we report the distance between the AT2R and B2R in PC12W cell membranes to be 50+/-5 A, providing evidence and quantification of receptor heterodimerization as the mechanism for enhancing NO production. The rate of AT2R-B2R heterodimer formation is largely a function of the degree of AT2R-B2R expression. The physical association between the dimerized receptors initiates changes in intracellular phosphoprotein signaling activities leading to phosphorylation of c-Jun terminal kinase, phosphotyrosine phosphatase, inhibitory protein kappaBalpha, and activating transcription factor 2; dephosphorylation of p38 and p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase and signal transducer inhibitor of transcription 3; and enhancing production of NO and cGMP. Controlling the expression of AT2R-B2R, consequently influencing their biologically active dimerization, presents a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of hypertension and other cardiovascular and renal disorders.},

During active shortening under otherwise identical conditions, the sarcomere length change was taken up approximately equally by A- and I-bands. Several potential artifacts that could give rise to apparent A-band shortening were considered and judged unlikely. Results obtained with polarization microscopy were similar to those obtained with electron microscopy.

Thus, pauses and steps are reflected not only in sarcomere length and segment length signals, but in the muscle length signal as well. We review several of the more illuminating features of stepwise shortening, as well as new ultrastructural observations which, taken together, point to an hypothesis for the generation of steps. The steps may be generated by shortening of one or another of the sarcomere's filaments: connecting filaments in the unactivated myofibril and thick filaments in the activated myofibril.

It can catalyze NADH-dependent reduction of S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO); as well as NAD(+)-dependent oxidation of hydroxymethylglutathione (HMGSH; an adduct formed by the spontaneous reaction between formaldehyde and glutathione). While initially recognized as the enzyme that is involved in formaldehyde detoxification, increasing amount of evidence has shown that GSNOR also plays a significant role in nitric oxide mediated signaling through its modulation of protein S-nitrosothiol signaling. In humans, GSNOR/S-nitrosothiols have been implicated in the etiology of several diseases including lung cancer, cystic fibrosis, asthma, pulmonary hypertension, and neuronal dysfunction. Currently, it is not possible to monitor the activity of GSNOR in live cells. In this article, we present a new compound, O-aminobenzoyl-S-nitrosoglutathione (OAbz-GSNO), which acts as a fluorogenic pseudo-substrate for GSNOR with an estimated Km value of 320µM. The weak OAbz-GSNO fluorescence increases by approximately 14 fold upon reduction of its S-NO moiety. In live cell imaging studies, OAbz-GSNO is readily taken up by primary pulmonary endothelial cells and localizes to the same perinuclear region as GSNOR. The perinuclear OAbz-GSNO fluorescence increases in a time dependent manner and this increase in fluorescence is abolished by siRNA knockdown of GSNOR or by treatment with GSNOR-specific inhibitors N6022 and C3. Taken together, these data demonstrate that OAbz-GSNO can be used as a tool to monitor the activity of GSNOR in live cells.},

Commercial applications range from the macroscopic (e.g. aerodynamic investigations in wind tunnels, monitoring of oxygen concentration during fermentation, and measurement of biological oxygen demand) to the microscopic (e.g. imaging of oxygen in blood, tissue, cells and other biological samples). Problems hindering the design of improved oxygen sensors include non-linear Stern-Volmer calibration plots and the multi-exponentiality of measured lifetime decays, both of which are attributed primarily to heterogeneity of the sensor molecule in the polymer support matrix. Conventional, confocal and two-photon fluorescence microscopy have proven to be invaluable tools with which the microscale heterogeneity and response of luminescence-based oxygen sensors can be investigated and compared to the macroscopic response. Results obtained for three ruthenium(II) alpha-diimine complexes in polydimethylsiloxane polymer supports indicate the presence of unquenched microcrystals within the polymer matrix that probably degrade oxygen quenching sensitivity and linearity of the Stern-Volmer quenching plot. Two-photon fluorescence microscopy proved most useful for imaging microcrystals within sensor films, and conventional microscopy allowed direct comparison between microscopic and macroscopic sensor response. The implications of the results in the rational design and mass production of luminescence-based oxygen sensors are significant.},

The angiotensin II type I receptor (AT1R) belongs to class B GPCRs that recycle slowly back to the cell surface. Previous studies have proposed that Rab11 controls the recycling of AT1R; however, recent reports show that Rab4, a rapid recycling regulator, co-localizes also with internalized AT1R. Different from the subcellular co-localization provided by fluorescence microscopy, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) microscopy provided the spatial relationship of AT1R with Rab4 and Rab11 in the nanometer-range proximity during the entire course of AT1R recycling. During the early recycling stage, internalized AT1Rs were mainly associated with Rab4 in the cytoplasm. During the mid-recycling stage, AT1Rs were associated with both Rab4 and Rab11 in the perinuclear compartments. However, during the late-recycling stage, AT1Rs were mainly associated with Rab11, both in the perinuclear compartments and the plasma membrane. Co-immunoprecipitation data confirmed these dynamic associations, which were disrupted by silencing of either the Rab4 or Rab11 gene. Based on these observations, we propose a Rab4 and Rab11 coordinated model for AT1R recycling.},

	abstract = {The estrogen receptor (ER) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that acts as a homodimer. Truncated estrogen receptor product-1 (TERP-1) is a pituitary-specific, estrogen-induced, isoform of rat ERalpha that is transcribed from a unique start site and contains only the C-terminal region of the full-length receptor. TERP-1 does not affect transcription directly but suppresses ligand-activated ERalpha and ERbeta activity. Because TERP-1 contains a dimerization domain and part of the coactivator binding pocket, we hypothesized that it modulates ER function by direct interactions with full-length ER or the steroid receptor coactivator, SRC-1. Localization studies demonstrate that TERP-1 is present in the cytoplasm and nucleus of transfected cells and colocalizes with nuclear ER. Protein binding studies show that TERP-1 forms heterodimers with both ERalpha and ERbeta and inhibits ERalpha binding to its cognate DNA response element. TERP-1 also binds SRC-1, and increasing levels of SRC-1 decrease the TERP-1-ERalpha interactions, in agreement with the rescue of TERP-1-suppressed ERalpha transcriptional activity by SRC-1. Mutational analysis of TERP-1 and ERalpha in the activation helix and the AF-2 dimerization helix indicates that TERP-1 acts predominantly through dimerization with ERalpha. Therefore, TERP-1 suppression of ER transcription occurs primarily by formation of inactive heterodimers and secondarily by competition for coactivators.},

	doi = {10.1002/dvdy.23711},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: During gastrulation, an embryo acquires the three primordial germ layers that will give rise to all of the tissues in the body. In amniote embryos, this process occurs via an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) of epiblast cells at the primitive streak. Although the primitive streak is vital to development, many aspects of how it forms and functions remain poorly understood.
RESULTS: Using live, 4 dimensional imaging and immunohistochemistry, we have shown that the posterior epiblast of the pre-streak murine embryo does not display convergence and extension behavior or large scale migration or rearrangement of a cell population. Instead, the primitive streak develops in situ and elongates by progressive initiation EMT in the posterior epiblast. Loss of basal lamina (BL) is the first step of this EMT, and is strictly correlated with ingression of nascent mesoderm. Once the BL is lost in a given region, cells leave the epiblast by apical constriction in order to enter the primitive streak.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first description of dynamic cell behavior during primitive streak formation in the mouse embryo, and reveals mechanisms that are quite distinct from those observed in other amniote model systems. Unlike chick and rabbit, the murine primitive streak arises in situ by progressive initiation of EMT beginning in the posterior epiblast, without large-scale movement or convergence and extension of epiblast cells.},

This study characterized the effect of NO(*) on mitochondrial membrane changes by exploring the relationship among NO(*), excitatory receptor activation, and the induction of peroxynitrite, a highly toxic NO(*) reactant, to neuronal injury. Cultured rat cortical neurons were exposed to the NO(*) generator, diethylenetriamine/nitric oxide adduct, and were examined for signs of cell death, mitochondrial membrane potential changes (Deltapsi(m)), and the induction of a mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT). Neurons were also examined for nitrotyrosine (NT) immunoreactivity, a marker of reactive nitrogen species (RNS) formation. Neurons exposed to NO(*) or to N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) exhibited similar rapid depolarization of mitochondria, which was prevented by an NMDA receptor antagonist. Electrophysiological studies demonstrated NO(*) potentiation of NMDA-induced NMDA receptor currents. NO(*) and NMDA-treated neurons had evidence of mitochondrial-specific NT immunoreactivity that was prevented by a SOD/catalase mimetic (EUK-134). EUK-134 treatment reduced both NO(*) and NMDA-induced NT formation and neuronal cell death. EUK-134 did not prevent NO-induced Deltapsi(m) but partially prevented NMDA-induced Deltapsi(m) loss. Although NO(*) and NMDA both induced MPT and MPT inhibitors prevented NO-induced Deltapsi(m), they did not result in significant neuroprotection, in contrast to treatment designed to decrease peroxynitrite formation. These data suggest that NO-induced NMDA receptor activation is closely linked to intramitochondrial NO-peroxynitrite/RNS formation and thereby acts as a major mediator of neuronal cell death.},

The growth and physiology of bacterial cells in these colonies may be influenced by the microenvironment around the colony, or alternatively the cells within the colony may modify the microenvironment (e.g., pH, redox potential) due to their metabolic activity. While cheese pH may be measured at macro level there remains a significant knowledge gap relating to the degree of micro-heterogeneity of pH within the cheese matrix and its relationship with microbial, enzymatic and physiochemical parameters and ultimately with cheese quality, consistency and ripening patterns. The pH of cheese samples was monitored both at macroscopic scale and at microscopic scale, using a non-destructive microscopic technique employing C-SNARF-4 and Oregon Green 488 fluorescent probes. The objectives of this work were to evaluate the suitability of these dyes for microscale pH measurements in natural cheese matrices and to enhance the sensitivity and extend the useful pH range of these probes using fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM). In particular, fluorescence lifetime of Oregon Green 488 proved to be sensitive probe to map pH micro heterogeneity within cheese matrices. Good agreement was observed between macroscopic scale pH measurement by FLIM and by traditional pH methods, but in addition considerable localized microheterogeneity in pH was evident within the curd matrix with pH range between 4.0 and 5.5. This technique provides significant potential to further investigate the relationship between cheese matrix physico-chemistry and bacterial metabolism during cheese manufacture and ripening.},

Millions of people suffer from hearing and balance deficits caused by damage to hair cells as a result of exposure to noise, aminoglycoside antibiotics, and antitumor drugs. In some species such damage can be reversed through the production of new cells. This proliferative response is limited in mammals but it has been hypothesized that damaged hair cells might survive and undergo intracellular repair. We examined the fate of bullfrog saccular hair cells after exposure to a low dose of the aminoglycoside antibiotic gentamicin to determine whether hair cells could survive such treatment and subsequently be repaired. In organ cultures of the bullfrog saccule a combination of time-lapse video microscopy, two-photon microscopy, electron microscopy, and immunocytochemistry showed that hair cells can lose their hair bundle and survive as bundleless cells for at least 1 week. Time-lapse and electron microscopy revealed stages in the separation of the bundle from the cell body. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of cultures fixed 2, 4, and 7 days after antibiotic treatment showed that numerous new hair bundles were produced between 4 and 7 days of culture. Further examination revealed hair cells with small repaired hair bundles alongside damaged remnants of larger surviving bundles. The results indicate that sensory hair cells can undergo intracellular self-repair in the absence of mitosis, offering new possibilities for functional hair cell recovery and an explanation for non-proliferative recovery.},

Xenopus mesendoderm cells migrate collectively along a fibronectin (FN) substrate at gastrulation but how the adhesive and mechanical forces required for these movements are generated and transmitted is unclear. Traction force microscopy (TFM) was used to establish that traction stresses are limited primarily to leading edge cells in mesendoderm explants and that these forces are balanced by intercellular stresses in follower rows. This is further reflected in the morphology of these cells, with broad lamellipodial protrusions, mature focal adhesions and a gradient of activated Rac1 evident at the leading edge; while small protrusions, rapid turnover of immature focal adhesions, and lack of a Rac1 activity gradient characterize cells in following rows. Depletion of keratin (8) with antisense morpholinos results in high traction stresses in follower row cells, misdirected protrusions, and the formation of actin stress fibers anchored in streak-like focal adhesions. We propose that maintenance of mechanical integrity in the mesendoderm by keratin intermediate filaments is required to balance stresses within the tissue to regulate collective cell movements.},

	abstract = {Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the leading cancers in men in the USA. Lack of experimental tools that predict therapy response is one of the limitations of current therapeutic regimens. Mitochondrial dysfunctions including defective oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in cancer inhibit apoptosis by modulating ROS production and cellular signaling. Thus, correction of mitochondrial dysfunction and induction of apoptosis are promising strategies in cancer treatment. We have used Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM) to quantify mitochondrial metabolic response in PCa cells by tracking auto-fluorescent NAD(P)H, FAD and tryptophan (Trp) lifetimes and their enzyme-bound fractions as markers, before and after treatment with anti-cancer drug doxorubicin. A 3-channel FLIM assay and quantitative analysis of these markers for cellular metabolism show in response to doxorubicin, NAD(P)H mean fluorescence lifetime (τm) and enzyme-bound (a2\%) fraction increased, FAD enzyme-bound (a1\%) fraction was decreased, NAD(P)H-a2\%/FAD-a1\% FLIM-based redox ratio and ROS increased, followed by induction of apoptosis. For the first time, a FRET assay in PCa cells shows Trp-quenching due to Trp-NAD(P)H interactions, correlating energy transfer efficiencies (E\%) vs NAD(P)H-a2\%/FAD-a1\% as sensitive parameters in predicting drug response. Applying this FLIM assay as early predictor of drug response would meet one of the important goals in cancer treatment.},

	abstract = {Human CO2 respiration requires rapid conversion between CO2 and HCO3(-) Carbonic anhydrase II facilitates this reversible reaction inside red blood cells, and band 3 [anion exchanger 1 (AE1)] provides a passage for HCO3(-) flux across the cell membrane. These 2 proteins are core components of the CO2 transport metabolon. Intracellular H2O is necessary for CO2/HCO3(-) conversion. However, abundantly expressed aquaporin 1 (AQP1) in erythrocytes is thought not to be part of band 3 complexes or the CO2 transport metabolon. To solve this conundrum, we used Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) measured by fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM-FRET) and identified interaction between aquaporin-1 and band 3 at a distance of 8 nm, within the range of dipole-dipole interaction. Notably, their interaction was adaptable to membrane tonicity changes. This suggests that the function of AQP1 in tonicity response could be coupled or correlated to its function in band 3-mediated CO2/HCO3(-) exchange. By demonstrating AQP1 as a mobile component of the CO2 transport metabolon, our results uncover a potential role of water channel in blood CO2 transport and respiration.-Hsu, K., Lee, T.-Y., Periasamy, A., Kao, F.-J., Li, L.-T., Lin, C.-Y., Lin, H.-J., Lin, M.

To further enhance hydrophobicity and absorption capacity of oil, PEI/RGO PU-DW sponge is further coated with 20\% phenyltrimethoxysilane (PTMOS). The PTMOS/PEI/RGO PU-DW sponge absorbs various oils within 20s, with maximum absorption capacity values of 880\% and 840\% for bicycle chain oil and motorcycle engine oil, respectively. The absorbed oils were released completely by squeezing or immersed in hexane. The PTMOS/PEI/RGO PU-DW sponge efficiently separates oil/water mixtures through a flowing system.

The key is that zebrafish shows bright red photoluminescence in the presence of apoptotic cells. The toxicity of the GQDs has also been investigated with the GQDs exhibiting high biocompatibility as they were excreted from the zebrafish's body without affecting its growth significantly at a concentration lower than 2 mg mL(-1) over a period of 4 to 72 hour post fertilization. The GQDs have further been used to image human breast adenocarcinoma cell line (MCF-7 cells), human cervical cancer cell line (HeLa cells), and normal human mammary epithelial cell line (MCF-10A).

	abstract = {In this study, highly hydrophilic and photoluminescent sheets of reduced graphene oxide decorated with carbon dots (C-dots@RGO), methylene blue (MB), and a probe DNA have been used for the detection of DNA. The photoluminescence of C-dots@RGO is quenched by MB, which is restored in the presence of a target DNA. The combination of the C-dots@RGO, MB, and a DNA probe is selective for perfectly matched DNA over mismatched DNA, mainly because relative to single-stranded DNA, double-stranded DNA intercalates more strongly with MB, but interacts more weakly with RGO. In the presence of a target DNA, MB intercalates with the as-formed double-stranded DNA and is released from the surface of C-dots@RGO, leading to "turn-on" photoluminescence. The practicality of this assay has been validated by the determination of tumor suppressor gene BRCA1, with linearity over the concentration range from 25 to 250 nM and a limit of detection (LOD, at a signal-to-noise ratio of 3) of 14.6 nM. The C-dots@RGO probe provides higher specificity towards target DNA than towards common salts, carbohydrates, amino acids, and proteins found in real samples. Having the advantages of simplicity, cost-effectiveness, selectivity, and sensitivity, the DNA-P/C-dots@RGO-MB probe on microwells has been successfully employed for the detection of DNA, suggesting its potential for multiple analyses of DNA targets when various DNA probes are employed.},

Zinc acetate and graphene oxide are reduced by catechin to form graphene-zinc oxide nanospheres (G-ZnO NSs; average diameter of (45.3 ± 3.7) nm) in the presence of ethylenediamine (EDA) as a stabilizing agent and gold nanorods (Au NRs) at 300 °C for 2 h. Then Au NRs are deposited onto as-formed G-ZnO NSs to form G-ZnO-Au NCs. Upon ultraviolet light activation, G-ZnO-Au NCs (4 mg mL(-1)) in methanol generates electron-hole pairs. Methanol (hydroxyl group) assists in trapping holes, enabling photogenerated electrons to catalyze reduction of nitrobenzene (NB) to aniline with a yield of 97.8\% during a reaction course of 140 min. The efficiency of G-ZnO-Au NCs is 3.5- and 4.5-fold higher than those provided by commercial TiO2 and ZnO NSs, respectively. Surface assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry has been for the first time applied to detect the intermediates (nitrosobenzene and phenylhydroxylamine) and major product (aniline) of NB through photoelectrocatalytic or photocatalytic reactions. The result reveals that the reduction of NB to aniline is through nitrosobenzene to phenylhydroxylamine in the photoelectrocatalytic reaction, while via nitrosobenzene directly in the photocatalytic reaction. G-ZnO-Au NC photocatalyst holds great potential in removal of organic pollutants like NB and in the production of aniline.},

	abstract = {We have developed a sensitive and selective photoluminescence (PL) quenching assay for the detection of acetylcholine (ACh) that uses reduced graphene oxide decorated with carbon dots (C-dots@RGO). The highly stable C-dots@RGO synthesized from catechin and graphene oxide through a hydrothermal reaction displays excitation-wavelength dependence of PL. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) converts ACh to choline, which in turn is oxidized by choline oxidase (ChOx) to produce betaine and H2O2 that generates the reactive oxygen species (ROS). The as-produced ROS induces PL quenching of the C-dots@RGO through an etching process. With respect to sensitivity, the optimal reaction/sensing temperature and pH are 37 °C and 9.0, respectively, using C-dots@RGO (0.4 mg·mL(-1)) and AChE and ChOx at the activities of 0.5 and 0.1 unit·mL(-1), respectively. The PL intensity (excitation/emission wavelengths 365/440 nm) of the C-dots@RGO is inversely proportional to the concentration of ACh over a range of 0.05-10 nM (r = 0.997), with a limit of detection (signal-to-noise ratio 3) of 30 pM.

Full-length CrdS was synthesised with no variations in primary structure, following analysis of tryptic fragments by MALDI-TOF/TOF Mass Spectrometry. Preparative scale WG-CFPS in dialysis mode with Brij-58 yielded CrdS in mg/ml quantities. Analysis of structural and functional properties of CrdS during protein synthesis showed that CrdS was co-translationally inserted in DMPC liposomes during WG-CFPS, and these liposomes could be purified in a single step by density gradient floatation. Incorporated CrdS exhibited a random orientation topology. Following affinity purification of CrdS, the protein was reconstituted in nanodiscs with Escherichia coli lipids or POPC and a membrane scaffold protein MSP1E3D1. CrdS nanodiscs were characterised by small-angle X-ray scattering using synchrotron radiation and the data obtained were consistent with insertion of CrdS into bilayers. We found CrdS synthesised in the presence of the Ac-AAAAAAD surfactant peptide or co-translationally inserted in liposomes made from E. coli lipids to be catalytically competent. Conversely, CrdS synthesised with only Brij-58 was inactive. Our findings pave the way for future structural studies of this industrially important catalytic membrane protein.},

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy studies reveal that ADH has been well immobilized in the biocomposite film. Scanning electron microscopy studies confirm the discriminate surface morphology of various components present in the biocomposite film.

	abstract = {Electrochemically active composite film that contains multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), Nafion (NF), and poly(malachite green) (PMG) has been synthesized on glassy carbon electrode (GCE), gold, and indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes by potentiodynamic method. The presence of MWCNTs in the composite film (MWCNT-NF-PMG) enhances the surface coverage concentration (Γ) of PMG by fivefold. Similarly, an electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance study revealed enhancement in the deposition of PMG at MWCNT-NF film when compared with bare and only NF modified electrodes. The surface morphology of the composite film was studied using atomic force microscopy, which revealed that the PMG incorporated on MWCNT-NF film. The composite film exhibited enhanced electrocatalytic activity toward the mixture of biochemical compounds catechol and quinol. The electrocatalytic responses of analytes at MWCNT-NF-PMG composite film were measured using both cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). From electrocatalysis studies, well-separated voltammetric peaks were obtained at the composite film for catechol and quinol with a peak separation of 147mV. The sensitivity values of the composite film toward catechol and quinol by the DPV technique were 0.4 and 3.2mAmM(-1)cm(-2), respectively, which are higher than the values obtained by the CV technique. Similarly, the above-mentioned values are better than the previously reported electroanalytical values for the same analytes.},

	abstract = {We investigated the direct electrochemistry of glucose oxidase (GOx) at gelatin-multiwalled carbon nanotube (GCNT) modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE). GOx was covalently immobilized onto GCNT modified GCE through the well known glutaraldehyde (GAD) chemistry. The immobilized GOx showed a pair of well-defined reversible redox peaks with a formal potential (E(0)') of -0.40V and a peak to peak separation (ΔE(p)) of 47mV. The surface coverage concentration (Г) of GOx in GCNT/GOx/GAD composite film modified GCE was 3.88×10(-9)mol cm(-2) which indicates the high enzyme loading. The electron transfer rate constant (k(s)) of GOx immobilized onto GCNT was 1.08s(-1) which validates a rapid electron transfer processes. The composite film shows linear response towards 6.30 to 20.09mM glucose. We observed a good sensitivity of 2.47μA mM(-)(1)cm(-2) for glucose at the composite film. The fabricated biosensor displayed two weeks stability. Moreover, it shows no response to 0.5mM of ascorbic acid (AA), uric acid (UA), acetaminophen (AP), pyruvate (PA) and lactate (LA) which shows its potential application in the determination of glucose from human serum samples. The composite film exhibits excellent recovery for glucose in human serum at physiological pH with good practical applicability.},

The presence of MWCNTs in the composite film (MWCNTs-NF-PMG) enhances surface coverage concentration (Gamma) of PMG to approximately 396\%, and increases the electron transfer rate constant (k(s)) to approximately 305\%. Similarly, electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance study reveals the enhancement in the deposition of PMG at MWCNTs-NF film. The surface morphology of the composite film deposited on ITO electrode has been studied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). These two techniques reveal that the PMG incorporated on MWCNTs-NF film. The MWCNTs-NF-PMG composite film also exhibits promising enhanced electrocatalytic activity towards the simple aliphatic alcohols such as methanol, ethanol and propanol. The electroanalytical responses of analytes at NF-PMG and MWCNTs-NF-PMG films were measured using both cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). From electroanalytical studies, well defined voltammetric peaks have been obtained at MWCNTs-NF-PMG composite film for methanol, ethanol and propanol at Epa=609, 614 and 602mV respectively. The sensitivity of MWCNTs-NF-PMG composite film towards methanol, ethanol and propanol in CV technique are 0.59, 0.36 and 0.92microAmM(-1)cm(-2) respectively, which are higher than NF-PMG film. Further, the sensitivity values obtained using DPV are higher than the values obtained using CV technique.},

	abstract = {Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is an important cholinesterase enzyme present in the synaptic clefts of living organisms. It maintains the levels of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine by catalyzing the hydrolysis reaction of acetylcholine to thiocholine. This catalytic activity of AChE is drastically inhibited by trace amounts of organophosphorus (OP) pesticides present in the environment. As a result, effective monitoring of OP pesticides in the environment is very desirable and has been done successfully in recent years with the use of nanomaterial-based AChE sensors. In such sensors, the enzyme AChE has been immobilized onto nanomaterials like multiwalled carbon nanotubes, gold nanoparticles, zirconia nanoparticles, cadmium sulphide nano particles or quantum dots. These nanomaterial matrices promote significant enhancements of OP pesticide determinations, with the thiocholine oxidation occurring at much lower oxidation potentials. Moreover, nanomaterial-based AChE sensors with rapid response, increased operational and long storage stability are extremely well suited for OP pesticide determination over a wide concentration range. In this review, the unique advantages of using nanomaterials as AChE immobilization matrices are discussed. Further, detection limits, sensitivities and correlation coefficients obtained using various electroanalytical techniques have also been compared with chromatographic techniques.},

The time averaged specklegram, recorded in the image plane, is scanned by the pointwise method. From the values of the spacings of Young's fringes, measured at various points, the corresponding displacement pattern in the form of a 40 x 30 matrix, equal to that of the cardiac region, is reconstructed and color-coded by a PDP 11/23 image processor. This pattern shows significant variations in displacements at various locations. Depending on the clinical status of the subjects, further changes in the pattern are observed. The reconstructed cardiac displacement patterns, obtained by this new noncontact and noninvasive technique, provide information on the functioning of various parts of the heart in cardiac disorders which are in qualitative agreement with that of two-dimensional echocardiography.},
