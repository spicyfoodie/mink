Formerly, the cause of these root destructions was usually caries attack due to a failure of patients to practise adequate oral hygiene measures. However, with increasing dental motivation and health consciousness, patients--for example in the USA, Scandinavian countries and Switzerland--cause such lesions by vigorous, badly controlled brushing, often in combination with the consumption of 'healthy' vegetarian, erosive diets. The former problem of carious root destruction due to neglect thus seems to be gradually being replaced by the problem that self-care is not yet thoroughly understood, is exaggerated and is technically inadequate. Faulty brushing may result in severe damage to those gingival sites that require attention cariologically as well as periodontologically. To exploit all possibilities of (secondary) preventive management of patients, careful investigation and analysis of the clinical signs is required to identify the aetiology of the lesions in each case. Fortunately, therapeutic management of root lesions, regardless of their aetiology, is facilitated by modern restorative techniques and materials.\", u'issn': u'0020-6539', u'number': u'5', u'month': u'oct', u'volume': u'40', u'pages': u'283--288', u'keyword': u'Humans, Middle Aged, Aged, Dental Caries, Tooth Erosion, Tooth Abrasion, Tooth Diseases, Tooth Root', u'year': u'1990', u'pmid': u'2228267', u'journal': u'International Dental Journal', 'ID': 'konig_root_1990'}\n",

Previously, we identified gelsolin in a proteomics screen to identify proteins involved in inside-out control of integrins using the lymphocytic leukemia cell line L1210. Furthermore, we showed that gelsolin was involved in affinity regulation of \\u03b21 -integrins in the leukemic cell line U937. Here, we examined how gelsolin regulates \\u03b21 -integrin affinity in the leukemia cell line L1210. We show that gelsolin is mainly expressed at the cell membrane and is present near \\u03b21 -integrins. The role for actin polymerization in integrin affinity regulation was examined using the actin modulating agent jasplakinolide, which decreased \\u03b21 -integrin affinity.

METHODS: Eight junior national level competitive cyclists were separated into two groups; Group A trained under normoxic condition (21\\\\% O2) for 2 hours/day, 3 days/week for 3 weeks while Group B used the same training protocol under hypoxic condition (15\\\\% O2). After 3 weeks of each initial training condition, five weeks of self-training under usual field conditions intervened before the training condition was switched from NT to HT in Group A, from HT to NT in Group B. The subjects were tested at sea level before and after each training period. O2 uptake (O2), blood samples, and muscle deoxygenation were measured during bicycle exercise test. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: No changes in maximal workload, arterial O2 content, O2 at lactate threshold and O2max were observed before or after each training period. In contrast, deoxygenation change during submaximal exercise in the vastus lateralis was significantly higher at HT than NT (p {\\\\textless} 0.01).

This investigation examined the affects of two different resistance exercise protocols on muscle oxygenation, and the anabolic hormonal response to such exercise.\\nMETHODS: Eleven experienced resistance-trained male athletes performed four sets of the squat exercise using either a low-intensity, high-volume (LI; 15 repetitions at 60\\\\% one-repetition maximum [1-RM]) or high-intensity, low-volume (HI; 4 repetitions at 90\\\\% 1-RM) load.

Our theoretical and experimental results depict the lack of speckle amplitude and intensity contrasts to differentiate regions of motion from static areas.

Our findings demonstrate a good agreement between the theoretical and experimental results for logarithmic intensity-based contrasts. Logarithmic intensity-based motion and speckle-based contrast methods are validated and compared for in vivo human retinal vasculature visualization using high-speed swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) at 1060 nm. The vasculature was identified as regions of motion by creating LOGIV and DLOGIV tomograms: multiple B-scans were collected of individual slices through the retina and the variance of logarithmic intensities and differences of logarithmic intensities were calculated.

It is well known that neutrophils play an essential role in the early phase of hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury and determine the extent of tissue damage. Hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury can result in organ failure, which is linked to high mortality. Recent data indicate that the neuronal guidance receptor Plexin C1 is involved in the control of the acute inflammatory response and, as such, modulates the transmigration of neutrophils. Hence, we investigated the functional role of Plexin C1 in a mouse model of early hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury.\\nDESIGN: Animal study.\\nSETTING: University experimental laboratory.\\nSUBJECTS: Wild-type, PLXNC1 and chimeric mice.\\nINTERVENTIONS: Hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury or sham operation.\\nMEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We found that the functional inhibition of Plexin C1 in wild-type mice treated with an anti-Plexin C1 antibody and a Semaphorin 7A peptide reduced hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury, as measured by the levels of lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate, and alanine aminotransferase. This reduction in ischemia-reperfusion injury was accompanied by reduced numbers of neutrophils in ischemic hepatic tissue and reduced serum levels of inflammatory cytokines. Experiments using Plexin C1 receptor-deficient (PLXNC1) mice also demonstrated decreased hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury. Studies of chimeric mice revealed that the hematopoietic Plexin C1 knockout is crucial for reducing the extent of hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury.\\nCONCLUSIONS: These results describe a role for Plexin C1 during ischemia-reperfusion injury, highlight the role of hematopoietic Plexin C1 in the development of hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury, and suggest that Plexin C1 is a potential drug target.', u'issn': u'1530-0293', u'number': u'8', u'month': u'aug', u'volume': u'44', u'pages': u'e625--632', u'keyword': u'Animals, Mice, Disease Models, Animal, Male, Neutrophils, Antigens, CD, Liver, Reperfusion Injury, Alanine Transaminase, Aspartic Acid, Cell Adhesion Molecules, Neuronal, GPI-Linked Proteins, Inflammation Mediators, L-Lactate Dehydrogenase, Semaphorins', u'year': u'2016', u'pmid': u'26963322', u'journal': u'Critical Care Medicine', 'ID': 'konig_inhibition_2016'}\n",

By combining chemical genetics with multimodal imaging, we have identified an autocrine feed-forward loop in tumor cells in which tumor-derived VEGF stimulates VEGF production via VEGFR2-dependent activation of mTOR, substantially amplifying the initial proangiogenic signal. Disruption of this feed-forward loop by chemical perturbation or knockdown of VEGFR2 in tumor cells dramatically inhibited production of VEGF in vitro and in vivo. This disruption was sufficient to prevent tumor growth in vivo. In patients with lung cancer, we found that this VEGF:VEGFR2 feed-forward loop was active, as the level of VEGF/VEGFR2 binding in tumor cells was highly correlated to tumor angiogenesis. We further demonstrated that inhibition of tumor cell VEGFR2 induces feedback activation of the IRS/MAPK signaling cascade. Most strikingly, combined pharmacological inhibition of VEGFR2 (ZD6474) and MEK (PD0325901) in tumor cells resulted in dramatic tumor shrinkage, whereas monotherapy only modestly slowed tumor growth. Thus, a tumor cell-autonomous VEGF:VEGFR2 feed-forward loop provides signal amplification required for the establishment of fully angiogenic tumors in lung cancer. Interrupting this feed-forward loop switches tumor cells from an angiogenic to a proliferative phenotype that sensitizes tumor cells to MAPK inhibition.', u'issn': u'1558-8238', u'number': u'4', u'month': u'apr', u'volume': u'123', u'pages': u'1732--1740', u'keyword': u'Cell Line, Tumor, Humans, Animals, Mice, Cell Transformation, Neoplastic, Lung Neoplasms, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A, MAP Kinase Signaling System, Mice, Nude, Neovascularization, Pathologic, Antineoplastic Agents, Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung, Quinazolines, Benzamides, Diphenylamine, Feedback, Physiological, Piperidines, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2', u'author': u'Chatterjee, Sampurna and Heukamp, Lukas C. and Siobal, Maike and Sch\\xf6ttle, Jakob and Wieczorek, Caroline and Peifer, Martin and Frasca, Davide and Koker, Mirjam and K\\xf6nig, Katharina and Meder, Lydia and Rauh, Daniel and Buettner, Reinhard and Wolf, J\\xfcrgen and Brekken, Rolf A. and Neumaier, Bernd and Christofori, Gerhard and Thomas, Roman K. and Ullrich, Roland T.', 'ID': 'chatterjee_tumor_2013', u'year': u'2013', u'pmid': u'23454747', u'journal': u'The Journal of Clinical Investigation', u'pmcid': u'PMC3613914'}\n",

Dysregulation of mTOR has been assigned to carcinogenesis and thus may be involved in cancer development. We have addressed the role of hamartin, phospho-tuberin (p-TSC2) and phospho-mTOR (p-mTOR) in a series of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) samples.\\nMETHODS: We collected 166 NSCLC and SCLC samples for immunohistochemical studies and performed western blot analyses in NSCLC and SCLC cell lines as well as comparative analyses with EGFR phosphorylation and downstream effectors.\\nRESULTS: In cell lines we found an inverse correlation between hamartin and p-mTOR expression. In surgical specimens cytoplasmic hamartin expression was observed in more than 50\\\\% of adenocarcinoma (AC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) compared to 14\\\\% of SCLC. P-mTOR and p-TSC2 staining was found in a minority of cases.There was a significant correlation between p-EGFR Tyr-1068, p-EGFR Tyr-992 and hamartin, and also between p-mTOR and p-EGFR Tyr-1173 in AC. In SCC an inverse correlation between hamartin and p-EGFR Tyr-992 was detected. Phosphorylation of TSC2 was associated with expression of MAP-Kinase. Hamartin, p-TSC2 and p-mTOR expression was not dependant of the EGFR mutation status. Hamartin expression is associated with poorer survival in SCC and SCLC.\\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings confirm the inhibitory role of the tuberous sclerosis complex for mTOR activation in lung cancer cell lines. These results reveal hamartin expression in a substantial subset of NSCLC and SCLC specimens, which may be due to EGFR signaling but is not dependant on EGFR mutations. Our data provide evidence for a functional role of the tuberous sclerosis complex in lung cancer.\\nVIRTUAL SLIDES: The virtual slide(s) for this article can be found here: http://www.diagnosticpathology.diagnomx.eu/vs/9274845161175223.', u'issn': u'1746-1596', u'month': u'mar', u'volume': u'9', u'pages': u'48', u'keyword': u'Humans, Signal Transduction, Female, Lung Neoplasms, Phosphorylation, Male, Immunohistochemistry, Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction, Blotting, Western, Adult, Middle Aged, Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung, Small Cell Lung Carcinoma, Tumor Suppressor Proteins, Genes, erbB-1, TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'ID': 'fuchs_tuberous-sclerosis_2014', u'year': u'2014', u'pmid': u'24593867', u'journal': u'Diagnostic Pathology', u'pmcid': u'PMC3975884'}\n",

Upon calcium-induced exocytosis, XlMyo1c is recruited to exocytosing CG membranes where actin coats then assemble.

Near-infrared (NIR)-emissive polymersomes (50-nm- to 50-microm-diameter polymer vesicles) were generated through cooperative self assembly of amphiphilic diblock copolymers and conjugated multi(porphyrin)-based NIR fluorophores (NIRFs). When compared with natural vesicles comprised of phospholipids, polymersomes were uniquely capable of incorporating and uniformly distributing numerous large hydrophobic NIRFs exclusively in their lamellar membranes. Within these sequestered compartments, long polymer chains regulate the mean fluorophore-fluorophore interspatial separation as well as the fluorophore-localized electronic environment. Porphyrin-based NIRFs manifest photophysical properties within the polymersomal matrix akin to those established for these high-emission dipole strength fluorophores in organic solvents, thereby yielding uniquely emissive vesicles. Furthermore, the total fluorescence emanating from the assemblies gives rise to a localized optical signal of sufficient intensity to penetrate through the dense tumor tissue of a live animal. Robust NIR-emissive polymersomes thus define a soft matter platform with exceptional potential to facilitate deep-tissue fluorescence-based imaging for in vivo diagnostic and drug-delivery applications.', u'issn': u'0027-8424', u'number': u'8', u'month': u'feb', u'volume': u'102', u'pages': u'2922--2927', u'keyword': u'Animals, Microscopy, Confocal, Male, Rats, Polymers, Rats, Inbred F344, Lipid Bilayers, Liposomes, Phospholipids, Polyethylenes', u'author': u'Ghoroghchian, P.

Truncated estrogen receptor product-1 (TERP-1) is a pituitary-specific, estrogen-induced, isoform of rat ERalpha that is transcribed from a unique start site and contains only the C-terminal region of the full-length receptor. TERP-1 does not affect transcription directly but suppresses ligand-activated ERalpha and ERbeta activity. Because TERP-1 contains a dimerization domain and part of the coactivator binding pocket, we hypothesized that it modulates ER function by direct interactions with full-length ER or the steroid receptor coactivator, SRC-1. Localization studies demonstrate that TERP-1 is present in the cytoplasm and nucleus of transfected cells and colocalizes with nuclear ER. Protein binding studies show that TERP-1 forms heterodimers with both ERalpha and ERbeta and inhibits ERalpha binding to its cognate DNA response element. TERP-1 also binds SRC-1, and increasing levels of SRC-1 decrease the TERP-1-ERalpha interactions, in agreement with the rescue of TERP-1-suppressed ERalpha transcriptional activity by SRC-1. Mutational analysis of TERP-1 and ERalpha in the activation helix and the AF-2 dimerization helix indicates that TERP-1 acts predominantly through dimerization with ERalpha. Therefore, TERP-1 suppression of ER transcription occurs primarily by formation of inactive heterodimers and secondarily by competition for coactivators.', u'issn': u'0021-9258', u'number': u'10', u'month': u'mar', u'volume': u'275', u'pages': u'7158--7166', u'keyword': u'Animals, COS Cells, Rats, Transcription Factors, Repressor Proteins, Estrogen Receptor alpha, Transcriptional Activation, Cell Nucleus, DNA-Binding Proteins, Dimerization, Response Elements, Binding, Competitive, DAX-1 Orphan Nuclear Receptor, Estrogen Receptor beta, Receptors, Estrogen, Receptors, Retinoic Acid', u'year': u'2000', u'pmid': u'10702284', u'journal': u'The Journal of Biological Chemistry', 'ID': 'resnick_truncated_2000'}\n",

Therefore, an indirect pragmatic approach was chosen: the interpretation of secular trends in caries prevalence and other parameters is used to estimate the relative importance of this method of topical fluoride administration and to compare it with the contributions by other methods of prevention. All methods of caries prevention, with the exception of population-administered measures such as fluoridation of drinking water or domestic salt, can only work when applied regularly and conscientiously. For this reason behavioural aspects such as compliance and the chances for widespread (if not universal) application have to be considered. There is indirect evidence that toothbrushing with fluoride toothpastes is a highly probable explanation for the decline of caries prevalence in developed countries since the 70s; moreover, toothbrushing, and the use of therapeutic dentifrices, is considered to meet spreading compliance because a 'healthy mouth' becomes more and more socially desirable in growing numbers of subpopulations.\", u'issn': u'0008-6568', u'pages': u'23--28', u'volume': u'27 Suppl 1', u'keyword': u'Humans, Child, Child, Preschool, Dental Caries, Prevalence, Patient Compliance, Toothpastes, Feeding Behavior, Toothbrushing, Dietary Carbohydrates, DMF Index, Motivation, Attitude to Health, Fluorides, Topical', u'year': u'1993', u'pmid': u'8500121', u'journal': u'Caries Research', 'ID': 'konig_role_1993'}\n",

Since histograms from synchronized cells are heavily distorted as compared to those obtained from exponentially growing cells and are quite similar to histograms from irradiated cells, they were used to test the suitability of the evaluation methods. Comparing the evaluated FCM data with the autoradiographic results from the same experimental series, the Gaussian integral method proved to be superior to the two other relatively simple approximation methods. The FCM histograms of irradiated cells were therefore analyzed only by the Gaussian integral method.

Pharmacologic and RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated suppression of ENOX1 impairs surrogate markers of tumor angiogenesis/vasculogenesis, providing support for the concept that ENOX1 represents an antiangiogenic druggable target. However, direct genetic evidence that demonstrates a role for ENOX1 in vascular development is lacking. In this study, we exploited a zebrafish embryonic model of development to address this question. Whole-mount in situ hybridization coupled with immunofluorescence performed on zebrafish embryos demonstrate that enox1 message and translated protein are expressed in most tissues, and its expression is enriched in blood vessels and heart. Morpholino-mediated suppression of Enox1 in Tg(fli1-eGFP) and Tg(flk1-eGFP) zebrafish embryos significantly impairs the development of vasculature and blood circulation. Using in vivo multiphoton microscopy, we show that morpholino-mediated knockdown of enox1 increases NADH levels, consistent with loss of enzyme. VJ115 is a small-molecule inhibitor of Enox1's oxidase activity shown to increase intracellular NADH in endothelial cells; we used VJ115 to determine if the oxidase activity was crucial for vascular development.

In this study, we explore the impact of the selection of the reference region size and location on the STC spectrum in 10 subjects with malignant breast tumors. Referencing from both contralateral and ipsilateral sides was performed. Regardless of the referencing, we are able to obtain consistent high contrast images of malignant lesions using the STC with less than 13\\\\% deviation. These results suggest that the STC measurements are independent of any type, location, and amount of normal breast tissue used for referencing.

Because mechanical loading of bone increases the rate of new bone formation, we hypothesized that mechanical stimulation of osteoblasts might increase their survival. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the effects of fluid shear stress (FSS) on osteoblast apoptosis using three osteoblast cell types: primary rat calvarial osteoblasts (RCOB), MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells, and UMR106 osteosarcoma cells. Cells were treated with TNF-alpha in the presence of cyclohexamide (CHX) to rapidly induce apoptosis. Osteoblasts showed significant signs of apoptosis within 4-6 h of exposure to TNF-alpha and CHX, and application of FSS (12 dyne/cm(2)) significantly attenuated this TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis. FSS activated PI3-kinase signaling, induced phosphorylation of Akt, and inhibited TNF-alpha-induced activation of caspase-3. Inhibition of PI3-kinase, using LY294002, blocked the ability of FSS to rescue osteoblasts from TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis and blocked FSS-induced inhibition of caspase-3 activation in osteoblasts treated with TNF-alpha. LY294002 did not, however, prevent FSS-induced phosphorylation of Akt suggesting that activation of Akt alone is not sufficient to rescue cells from apoptosis. This result also suggests that FSS can activate Akt via a PI3-kinase-independent pathway. These studies demonstrate for the first time that application of FSS to osteoblasts in vitro results in inhibition of TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis through a mechanism involving activation of PI3-kinase signaling and inhibition of caspases. FSS-induced activation of PI3-kinase may promote cell survival through a mechanism that is distinct from the Akt-mediated survival pathway.', u'issn': u'0021-9541', u'number': u'2', u'month': u'feb', u'volume': u'194', u'pages': u'194--205', u'keyword': u'Animals, Cells, Cultured, Rats, Stress, Mechanical, Non-NASA Center, Cell Survival, Osteoblasts, NASA Discipline Cell Biology, Apoptosis, Caspase 3, Caspase Inhibitors, Enzyme Activation, Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases, Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases, Proto-Oncogene Proteins, Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt, Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha', u'author': u'Pavalko, Fredrick M. and Gerard, Rita L. and Ponik, Suzanne M. and Gallagher, Patricia J. and Jin, Yijun and Norvell, Suzanne M.', u'year': u'2003', u'pmid': u'12494458', u'journal': u'Journal of Cellular Physiology', 'ID': 'pavalko_fluid_2003'}\n",

This platform was tested for delivery of the promising anti-inflammatory and antioxidant therapeutic molecule curcumin, which is currently limited in use in its free form due to poor pharmacokinetic properties. PPS microspheres efficiently encapsulated curcumin through oil-in-water emulsion and provided sustained, on demand release that was modulated in vitro by hydrogen peroxide concentration. The cytocompatible, curcumin-loaded microspheres preferentially targeted and scavenged intracellular ROS in activated macrophages, reduced in vitro cell death in the presence of cytotoxic levels of ROS, and decreased tissue-level ROS in vivo in the diabetic mouse hind limb ischemia model of peripheral arterial disease. Interestingly, due to the ROS scavenging behavior of PPS, the blank microparticles also showed inherent therapeutic properties that were synergistic with the effects of curcumin in these assays. Functionally, local delivery of curcumin-PPS microspheres accelerated recovery from hind limb ischemia in diabetic mice, as demonstrated using non-invasive imaging techniques.

Specific microparticles that are addressed to the polymer-coated microchip surface in a well defined pattern release preactivated amino acids upon melting, and thus allow combinatorial synthesis of high-complexity peptide arrays directly on the chip surface.

It is now widely accepted that the nucleus is a well organized and highly compartmentalized organelle and that this organization is intimately related to nuclear function. In this context, chromatin -initially considered a randomly entangled polymer- has also been shown to be structurally organized in interphase and its organization was found to be very important to gene regulation. Relevant and not completely answered questions are how chromatin organization is achieved and what mechanisms are responsible for changes in the positions of chromatin loci in the nucleus. A significant advance in the field resulted from tagging chromosome sites with bacterial operator sequences, and visualizing these tags using green fluorescent protein fused with the appropriate repressor protein. Simultaneously, fluorescence imaging techniques significantly evolved during the last years allowing the observation of the time evolution of processes in living specimens. In this context, the motion of the tagged locus was observed and analyzed to extract quantitative information regarding its dynamics. This review focuses on recent advances in our understanding of chromatin dynamics in interphase with the emphasis placed on the information obtained from single particle tracking (SPT) experiments. We introduce the basis of SPT methods and trajectories analysis, and summarize what has been learnt by using this new technology in the context of chromatin dynamics.

In ligaments and tendons, type I collagen is the principal structural element of the extracellular matrix, which acts to transmit force between bones or bone and muscle, respectively. Therefore, characterization of collagen fibril morphology and organization in fetal and skeletally mature animals is essential to understanding how tissues develop and obtain their mechanical attributes. In this study, tendons and ligaments from fetal rat, bovine, and feline, and mature rat were examined with scanning electron microscopy. At early fetal developmental stages, collagen fibrils show fibril overlap and interweaving, apparent fibril ends, and numerous bifurcating/fusing fibrils. Late in fetal development, collagen fibril ends are still present and fibril bundles (fibers) are clearly visible. Examination of collagen fibrils from skeletally mature tissues, reveals highly organized regions but still include fibril interweaving, and regions that are more randomly organized. Fibril bifurcations/fusions are still present in mature tissues but are less numerous than in fetal tissue. To address the continuity of fibrils in mature tissues, fibrils were examined in individual micrographs and consecutive overlaid micrographs. Extensive microscopic analysis of mature tendons and ligaments detected no fibril ends. These data strongly suggest that fibrils in mature ligament and tendon are either continuous or functionally continuous. Based upon this information and published data, we conclude that force within these tissues is directly transferred through collagen fibrils and not through an interfibrillar coupling, such as a proteoglycan bridge.', u'issn': u'0945-053X', u'number': u'2', u'month': u'mar', u'volume': u'25', u'pages': u'71--84', u'keyword': u'Collagen, Animals, Ligaments, Rats, Embryonic Development, Microscopy, Electron, Stress, Mechanical, Tendons', u'author': u'Provenzano, Paolo P. and Vanderby, Ray', u'year': u'2006', u'pmid': u'16271455', u'journal': u'Matrix Biology: Journal of the International Society for Matrix Biology', 'ID': 'provenzano_collagen_2006-1'}\n",

In this study, we used an array of biophysical experiments and cellular assays along with mutagenesis of VP40 to investigate the role of membrane penetration in VP40 assembly and egress.

Laser tweezers have been used for optical picoNewton force determination as well as for 3D cellular and intracellular micromanipulation, such as optical spermatozoa transportation in laser-assisted in vitro fertilization. Light intensities in the MW/cm2 range are necessary to confine motile spermatozoa in the optical trap. The enormous photon concentration in space and time results in non-resonant two-photon excitation of endogenous and exogenous absorbers with electronic transitions in the ultraviolet and visible spectral range. Trap-induced two-photon excitation of intracellular flurorophores can be used to study metabolism and vitality of motile cells without additional fluorescence excitation sources.

Here, we used fluorescence resonance energy transfer microscopy to show that when C/EBPalpha was recruited by Pit-1, the average distance separating the fluorophores labeling the proteins was less than 7 nm. A mutation in the Pit-1 homeodomain, or truncation of the C/EBPalpha transactivation domain disrupted the redistribution of C/EBPalpha by Pit-1. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis revealed that the mutant Pit-1 still associated with C/EBPalpha, and the truncated C/EBPalpha still associated with Pit-1, but these interactions were preferentially localized in regions of centromeric heterochromatin. In contrast, a truncation in C/EBPalpha that prevented DNA binding also blocked its association with Pit-1, suggesting that the binding of C/EBPalpha to DNA is a critical first step in specifying its association with Pit-1.

Prior to trapping, Chinese hamster ovary cells exhibited weak UVA-excited autofluorescence with maxima at 455 nm characteristic of beta-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate) emission. No strong effect of a 1064 nm NIR microbeam on fluorescence intensity and spectral characteristics was found during trapping, even for power densities up to 70 MW/cm2 and radiant exposures of 100 GJ/cm2. In contrast to the 1064 nm trap, a 760 nm trapping beam caused a two-fold autofluorescence increase within 5 min (about 20 GJ/cm2). Exposure to 365 nm UVA (1 W/cm2) during 1064 nm trapping significantly altered cellular autofluorescence, causing, within 10 min, a five-fold increase and a 6 nm red shift versus initial levels. We conclude that 1064 nm microbeams can be applied for an extended period without producing autofluorescence changes characteristic of alterations in the cellular redox state.

Early versions of MMM relied on imaging detectors to record emission signals from multiple foci simultaneously. For many turbid biological specimens, the scattering of emission photons results in blurred images and degrades the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We have recently demonstrated that a multianode photomultiplier tube (MAPMT) placed in a descanned configuration can effectively collect scattered emission photons from each focus into their corresponding anodes significantly improving image SNR for highly scattering specimens. Unfortunately, a descanned MMM has a longer detection path resulting in substantial emission photon loss. Optical design constraints in a descanned geometry further results in significant optical aberrations especially for large field-of-view (FOV), high NA objectives. Here, we introduce a non-descanned MMM based on MAPMT that substantially overcomes most of these drawbacks.

One of the principal determinants of morbidity and mortality following TBI is traumatic axonal injury (TAI). Current hypotheses on the pathogenesis of TAI involve activation of apoptotic cascades secondary to TBI. While a number of studies have demonstrated direct evidence for the activation of apoptotic cascades in TAI, the precise pathway by which these cascades are initiated remains a subject of intense investigation. As axolemmal disruption with the subsequent intra-axonal influx of large molecular weight species has been demonstrated to occur in relation to local axonal breakdown, attention has focused on cascades that may occur as a result of loss of ionic homeostasis. One proposed pathway by which this has been hypothesized to occur is the Ca(2+)-mediated activation of calmodulin and subsequent activation of the phosphatase calcineurin with dephosphorylation of a protein known as BAD, leading to a proapoptotic interaction between BAD and the mitochondrial protein Bcl-xL. While this pathway is an intriguing route for traumatic axonal pathogenesis, neither conventional immunocytochemical/histochemical nor ultrastructural approaches have had the capacity to shed insight on whether BAD and Bcl-xL interact in TAI in vivo. We describe the implementation of confocal and two-photon excitation fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) microscopy techniques through which we demonstrate interaction between the proapoptotic protein BAD and the prosurvival protein Bcl-xL within TAI following TBI.

These movements position and center the spindle within the cell. This analysis also suggests that contacts between the spindle and cortex are correlated with the decision to enter anaphase., Proper spindle positioning at anaphase onset is essential for normal tissue organization and function. Here we develop automated spindle-tracking software and apply it to characterize mitotic spindle dynamics in the Xenopus laevis embryonic epithelium. We find that metaphase spindles first undergo a sustained rotation that brings them on-axis with their final orientation. This sustained rotation is followed by a set of striking stereotyped rotational oscillations that bring the spindle into near contact with the cortex and then move it rapidly away from the cortex. These oscillations begin to subside soon before anaphase onset. Metrics extracted from the automatically tracked spindles indicate that final spindle position is determined largely by cell morphology and that spindles consistently center themselves in the XY-plane before anaphase onset. Finally, analysis of the relationship between spindle oscillations and spindle position relative to the cortex reveals an association between cortical contact and anaphase onset.

We examined the efficacy of utilizing the endogenous optical signals of two important ECM proteins, elastin (Eln), through autofluorescence, and type I collagen (ColI), through second harmonic generation (SHG), during mouse embryonic stem cell differentiation. After finding favorable overlap between antibody labeling and the endogenous fluorescent signal of Eln, we used this endogenous signal to map temporal changes in Eln and ColI during murine embryoid body differentiation and found that Eln increases until day 9 and then decreases slightly by day 12, while Col1 steadily increases over the 12-day period. Furthermore, we combined endogenous fluorescence imaging and SHG with antibody labeling of cardiomyocytes to examine the spatial relationship between Eln and ColI accumulation and cardiomyocyte differentiation. Eln was ubiquitously present, with enrichment in regions with cardiomyocyte differentiation, while there was an inverse correlation between ColI and cardiomyocyte differentiation.

Despite the pivotal role of these processes, experimental tools to fully probe the complex connectivity (and accessibility) of the cell interior with adequate spatiotemporal resolution are still lacking. Here, we show how the heterogeneity of molecular dynamics and the location of barriers to molecular motion can be mapped in live cells by exploiting a two-dimensional (2D) extension of the pair correlation function (pCF) analysis. Starting from a time series of images collected for the same field of view, the resulting 2D pCF is calculated in the proximity of each point for each time delay and allows us to probe the spatial distribution of the molecules that started from a given pixel. This 2D pCF yields an accurate description of the preferential diffusive routes. Furthermore, we combine this analysis with the image-derived mean-square displacement approach and gain information on the average nanoscopic molecular displacements in different directions. Through these quantities, we build a fluorescence-fluctuation-based diffusion tensor that contains information on speed and directionality of the local dynamical processes. Contrary to classical fluorescence correlation spectroscopy and related methods, this combined approach can distinguish between isotropic and anisotropic local diffusion.

We used the fluorescent probe Laurdan which is sensitive to the amount of water in the membrane to show that there is a spatial heterogeneity on the scale of few pixels (the size of the pixel is 50 nm). We calculated the pixel variance of the GP function and we found that the variance has a peak at the phase transition for 3 different samples made of pure lipids. The pixel variance has an abrupt change at the phase transition of the membrane and then it slowly decreases at higher temperature. The relatively large variance of the GP indicates that the liquid phase of the membrane is quite heterogeneous even several degrees higher than the phase transition temperature.

We investigated the role of the calcium-dependent protease calpain during neutrophil chemotaxis and found that calpain inhibition induced neutrophil adhesion, polarization, and rapid chemokinesis in the absence of exogenous activators. Resting neutrophils display constitutive calpain activity with mu-calpain being the predominant active isoform. Our findings suggest that constitutive calpain activity in resting neutrophils may function as a negative regulator of protrusion and migration. Specific inhibition of mu-calpain, but not m-calpain, induced neutrophil polarization and chemokinesis. In contrast to IL-8-induced chemokinesis, the chemokinesis induced by calpain inhibition was not reduced in the presence of pertussis toxin, suggesting that calpain functions downstream of G protein-coupled receptors. Further, both calpain inhibition and stimulation with IL-8 and formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP) induced an increase in Cdc42 and Rac activation. These findings are consistent with the involvement of calpain in chemotaxis pathways. Accordingly, calpain inhibition decreased neutrophil chemotaxis and directional persistence in a gradient of IL-8 and fMLP.

This is particularly true of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, a highly lethal disease characterized by a robust fibroinflammatory response, widespread vascular collapse, and hypoperfusion that together serve as primary mechanisms of treatment resistance. Free-fluid pressures, however, are relatively low in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and cannot account for the vascular collapse. Indeed, we have shown that the overexpression and deposition in the interstitium of high-molecular-weight hyaluronan (HA) is principally responsible for generating pressures that can reach 100\\xa0mmHg through the creation of a large gel-fluid phase. By interrogating a variety of tissues, tumor types, and experimental model systems, we show that an HA-dependent fluid phase contributes substantially to pressures in many solid tumors and has been largely unappreciated heretofore. We investigated the relative contributions of both freely mobile fluid and gel fluid to interstitial fluid pressure by performing simultaneous, real-time fluid-pressure measurements with both the classical wick-in-needle method (to estimate free-fluid pressure) and a piezoelectric pressure catheter transducer (which is capable of capturing pressures associated with either phase). We demonstrate further that systemic treatment with pegylated recombinant hyaluronidase (PEGPH20) depletes interstitial HA and eliminates the gel-fluid phase. This significantly reduces interstitial pressures and leaves primarily free fluid behind, relieving the barrier to drug delivery. These findings argue that quantifying the contributions of free- and gel-fluid phases to hydraulically transmitted pressures in a given cancer will be essential to designing the most appropriate and effective strategies to overcome this important and frequently underestimated resistance mechanism.', u'issn': u'1542-0086', u'number': u'9', u'month': u'may', u'volume': u'110', u'pages': u'2106--2119', u'keyword': u'Adenocarcinoma, Animals, Extracellular Fluid, Hyaluronic Acid, Hydrostatic Pressure, Mice, NIH 3T3 Cells, Pancreatic Neoplasms, Viscosity', 'ID': 'dufort_interstitial_2016', u'year': u'2016', u'pmid': u'27166818', u'journal': u'Biophysical Journal', u'pmcid': u'PMC4939548'}\n",

In this report, we show that the need for spatially resolved detectors in MMM results in a system that is more sensitive to the scattering of emission photons with reduced imaging depth. For imaging depths down to twice the scattering mean free path length of emission photons (2xl (s) (em)), the emission point spread function (PSF(em)) is found to consist of a narrow, diffraction limited distribution from ballistic emission photons and a broad, relatively low amplitude distribution from scattered photons. Since the scattered photon distribution is approximately 100 times wider than that of the unscattered photons at 2xl (s) (em), image contrast and depth are degraded without compromising resolution. To overcome the imaging depth limitation of MMM, we present a new design that replaces CCD cameras with multi-anode photomultiplier tubes (MAPMTs) allowing more efficient collection of scattered emission photons. We demonstrate that MAPMT-based MMM has imaging depth comparable to SMM with equivalent sensitivity by imaging tissue phantoms, ex vivo human skin specimens based on endogenous fluorophores, and green fluorescent protein (GFP) expressing neurons in mouse brain slices.', u'issn': u'1094-4087', u'number': u'18', u'month': u'sep', u'volume': u'15', u'pages': u'11658--11678', 'ID': 'kim_multifocal_2007', u'year': u'2007', u'pmid': u'19547526', u'journal': u'Optics Express', u'pmcid': u'PMC3060709'}\n",

Mycobacteria are exquisitely adapted macrophage pathogens, and observations in the mouse model of tuberculosis have suggested that mycobacterial growth is not inhibited in macrophages until adaptive immunity is induced. Using the optically transparent and genetically tractable zebrafish embryo-Mycobacterium marinum model of tuberculosis, we have directly examined early infection in the presence and absence of macrophages. The absence of macrophages led rapidly to higher bacterial burdens, suggesting that macrophages control infection early and are not an optimal growth niche. However, we show that macrophages play a critical role in tissue dissemination of mycobacteria.

Extracellular activation of TGF-\\u03b21 from its latent form provides spatiotemporal control over TGF-\\u03b21 signaling, but the current understanding of TGF-\\u03b21 activation does not emphasize cross talk between activators. Plasmin (PLS) and thrombospondin-1 (TSP1) have been studied individually as activators of TGF-\\u03b21, and in this work we used a systems-level approach with mathematical modeling and in vitro experiments to study the interplay between PLS and TSP1 in TGF-\\u03b21 activation. Simulations and steady-state analysis predicted a switch-like bistable transition between two levels of active TGF-\\u03b21, with an inverse correlation between PLS and TSP1. In particular, the model predicted that increasing PLS breaks a TSP1-TGF-\\u03b21 positive feedback loop and causes an unexpected net decrease in TGF-\\u03b21 activation. To test these predictions in vitro, we treated rat hepatocytes and hepatic stellate cells with PLS, which caused proteolytic cleavage of TSP1 and decreased activation of TGF-\\u03b21. The TGF-\\u03b21 activation levels showed a cooperative dose response, and a test of hysteresis in the cocultured cells validated that TGF-\\u03b21 activation is bistable. We conclude that switch-like behavior arises from natural competition between two distinct modes of TGF-\\u03b21 activation: a TSP1-mediated mode of high activation and a PLS-mediated mode of low activation. This switch suggests an explanation for the unexpected effects of the plasminogen activation system on TGF-\\u03b21 in fibrotic diseases in vivo, as well as novel prognostic and therapeutic approaches for diseases with TGF-\\u03b2 dysregulation.', u'issn': u'1542-0086', u'number': u'5', u'month': u'sep', u'volume': u'103', u'pages': u'1060--1068', u'keyword': u'Animals, Models, Biological, Rats, Protein Stability, Coculture Techniques, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Hepatocytes, Hepatic Stellate Cells, Fibrinolysin, Thrombospondin 1, Transforming Growth Factor beta1', 'ID': 'venkatraman_plasmin_2012', u'year': u'2012', u'pmid': u'23009856', u'journal': u'Biophysical Journal', u'pmcid': u'PMC3433618'}\n",

Rafts are postulated to be platforms, which by sequestering different membrane components can compartmentalize cellular processes and regulate signaling pathways. Despite an enormous effort in this area, the existence of these domains is still under debate due to the characteristics of the structures itself: small in size and highly mobile, which from the technical point of view implies using techniques with high spatial and temporal resolution. In this report we measured rapid fluctuations of the normalized ratio of the emission intensity at two wavelengths of Laurdan, a membrane fluorescent dye sensitive to local membrane packing. We observed generalized polarization fluctuations in the plasma membrane of intact rabbit erythrocytes and Chinese hamster ovary cells that can be explained by the existence of tightly packed micro-domains moving in a more fluid background phase. These structures, which display different lipid packing, have different sizes; they are found in the same cell and in the entire cell population.

However, the mechanisms behind the first step of separation, the switch of individuals into new niches, are unclear. One long-standing hypothesis, which was proposed for insects but never tested, is that early learning causes new ecological preferences, leading to a switch into a new niche within one generation. Here, we show that a host switch occurred within a parasitoid wasp, which is associated with the ability for early learning and the splitting into separate lineages during speciation. Lariophagus distinguendus consists of two genetically distinct lineages, most likely representing different species. One attacks drugstore beetle larvae (Stegobium paniceum (L.)), which were probably the ancestral host of both lineages. The drugstore beetle lineage has an innate host preference that cannot be altered by experience. In contrast, the second lineage is found on Sitophilus weevils as hosts and changes its preference by early learning. We conclude that a host switch has occurred in the ancestor of the second lineage, which must have been enabled by early learning.

SLIC overcomes many of the limitations of other optical correlation techniques for flow measurement, such as laser speckle, spatial temporal image correlation spectroscopy, and two-foci methods. One of the main advantages of SLIC is that the concept can be applied to measurements on a range of scales through simple zooming or modifications in the instrumentation. Additionally, SLIC is relatively insensitive to instrument noise through the use of correlation analysis and is insensitive to background.

Since the brain is sensitive to hypoxia, the cerebrovascular morbidity seen in OSA could be due to chronic, cumulative effects of intermittent hypoxia. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has the potential to noninvasively monitor brain tissue oxygen saturation (SO2), and changes in concentration of oxyhemoglobin [O2Hb], deoxyhemoglobin [HHb] and total hemoglobin [tHb] with real-time resolution. We hypothesized that brain tissue oxygenation would be worse during sleep in OSA relative to controls and sought to determine the practical use of NIRS in the sleep laboratory.\\n\\nDesign:\\nWe evaluated changes in brain tissue oxygenation using NIRS during overnight polysomnography.\\n\\nSetting:\\nStudies were conducted at University of Illinois, Chicago and Carle Hospital, Urbana, Illinois.\\n\\nPatients:\\nNineteen subjects with OSA and 14 healthy controls underwent continuous NIRS monitoring during polysomnography.\\n\\nMeasurements and Results:\\nWe observed significantly lower indexes of brain tissue oxygenation (SO2: 57.1 \\xb1 4.9 vs. 61.5 \\xb1 6.1), [O2Hb]: 22.8 \\xb1 7.7 vs. 31.5 \\xb1 9.1, and [tHb]: 38.6 \\xb1 11.2 vs. 48.6 \\xb111.4 \\u03bcmol/L) in OSA than controls (all P {\\\\textless}0.05).

Cdc42 function is best understood at the plasma membrane (PM), where it regulates cytoskeletal organization and cell polarization.

Here we analyze the spatial distribution of Cdc42 activity by moni\\xadtoring the dynamics of the Cdc42 FLARE biosensor using the phasor approach to FLIM-FRET. Phasor analysis revealed that Cdc42 is active at all Golgi cisternae and that this activity is controlled by Tuba and ARHGAP10, two Golgi-associated Cdc42 regulators. To our surprise, FGD1, another Cdc42 GEF at the Golgi, was not required for Cdc42 regulation at the Golgi, although its depletion decreased Cdc42 activity at the PM. Similarly, changes in Golgi morphology did not affect Cdc42 activity at the Golgi but were associated with a substantial reduction in PM-associated Cdc42 activity.

This zebrafish larval model is highly amenable to live imaging of leukocyte behavior, and we report that in rac2(-/-) larvae both neutrophils and macrophages are defective in basic motility, leading to impaired responses to localized wounds or infections. rac2(-/-) larvae are highly susceptible to infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which can be almost fully rescued by ectopic expression of either Rac2 or Rac1 specifically in neutrophils, indicating that these isoforms have partially overlapping functions in vivo. Rescue of Rac2 expression specifically in macrophages also confers resistance to Pseudomonas infection, highlighting an important role for Rac2 in this leukocyte population as well.

The prevalence of dental fluorosis in nine coastal villages where tea and seafish were regularly consumed ranged from 7\\\\% to 46\\\\%. Severe (pitting) dental fluorosis was rarely seen. The low fluorosis levels observed in non-magadi consuming communities in coastal villages indicate that a fluoride content of up to 0.8 mg/L in drinking water is acceptable under the prevailing conditions of temperature and diet. In contrast, the prevalence of dental fluorosis in nine villages located inland at 1500 m altitude, where fluoride-containing magadi was consumed, ranged from 53\\\\% to 100\\\\%, and severe (pitting) fluorosis was highly prevalent, ranging from 18\\\\% to 97\\\\%. The village with the highest fluoride content in the magadi samples collected showed the highest level of fluorosis. The urinary fluoride excretion of pre-schoolchildren from different villages corresponded with the level of fluorosis and the fluoride content in the magadi samples of the respective villages. Data on dental fluorosis from the magadi-consuming communities provide strong evidence that consumption of magadi was the major determinant of the observed high prevalence and severity of fluorosis in inland villages at 1500 m altitude.', u'issn': u'0301-5661', u'number': u'2', u'month': u'apr', u'volume': u'25', u'pages': u'170--176', u'keyword': u'Humans, Adolescent, Prevalence, Fluoridation, Fluorides, Chi-Square Distribution, Feeding Behavior, Fluorosis, Dental, Tanzania, Bicarbonates, Carbonates, Cooking, Food Additives, Statistics, Nonparametric', u'year': u'1997', u'pmid': u'9181293', u'journal': u'Community Dentistry and Oral Epidemiology', 'ID': 'mabelya_dental_1997'}\n",

On a stiff matrix, MSC cultured with conditioned media from mammary cancer cells expressed increased levels of \\u03b1-smooth muscle actin, a marker of CAF, compared with MSC cultured on a soft matrix. By contrast, MSC cultured on a stiff matrix secreted prosaposin that promoted proliferation and survival of mammary carcinoma cells but inhibited metastasis.

However, due to the fast dynamics and the tiny structures involved, a very high spatio-temporal resolution is required to catch the real behavior of molecules. Here we present the experimental protocol for studying the dynamics of fluorescently-labeled plasma-membrane proteins and lipids in live cells with high spatiotemporal resolution. Notably, this approach doesn\\u2019t need to track each molecule, but it calculates population behavior using all molecules in a given region of the membrane. The starting point is a fast imaging of a given region on the membrane. Afterwards, a complete spatio-temporal autocorrelation function is calculated correlating acquired images at increasing time delays, for example each 2, 3, n repetitions. It is possible to demonstrate that the width of the peak of the spatial autocorrelation function increases at increasing time delay as a function of particle movement due to diffusion. Therefore, fitting of the series of autocorrelation functions enables to extract the actual protein mean square displacement from imaging (iMSD), here presented in the form of apparent diffusivity vs average displacement. This yields a quantitative view of the average dynamics of single molecules with nanometer accuracy.

Drebrin-like protein (DBNL), which is homologous to yeast mAbp1 and is therefore known as mammalian actin-binding protein 1 (mAbp1), has been implicated in receptor-mediated endocytosis, vesicle recycling and dorsal ruffle formation. However, it is not known whether mAbp1 regulates podosome formation or cell invasion. In this study, we found that mAbp1 localizes to podosomes and is necessary for the formation of podosome rosettes in Src-transformed fibroblasts. Despite their structural similarity, mAbp1 and cortactin play distinct roles in podosome regulation. Cortactin was necessary for the formation of podosome dots, whereas mAbp1 was necessary for the formation of organized podosome rosettes in Src-transformed cells. We identified specific Src phosphorylation sites, Tyr337 and Tyr347 of mAbp1, which mediate the formation of podosome rosettes and degradation of the ECM. In contrast to dorsal ruffles, the interaction of mAbp1 with WASP-interacting protein (WIP) was not necessary for the formation of podosome rosettes. Finally, we showed that depletion of mAbp1 increased invasive cell migration, suggesting that mAbp1 differentially regulates matrix degradation and cell invasion.

We demonstrate that these regions are active transcription sites that release mRNA molecules in the nucleoplasm. Using fluctuation spectroscopy and the phasor analysis approach we were able to extract the local PolII elongation rate at each site as a function of time. We measured a four-fold variation in the average elongation between identical copies of the same gene measured simultaneously within the same cell, demonstrating a correlation between local transcription kinetics and the movement of the transcription site.

In the present report, high-resolution multiphoton tomography was used to investigate the cellular basis of bacteria killing of cancer cells in live mice. Lewis lung cancer cells (LLC) were genetically labeled with red fluorescent protein (RFP) and injected subcutaneously in nude mice. After tumor growth was observed, the mice were treated with A1-R bacteria expressing GFP, via tail-vein injection. Mice without A1-R treatment served as untreated controls. The imaging system was 3D scan head mounted on a flexible mechano-optical articulated arm. A tunable 80 MHz titanium:sapphire femtosecond laser (710-920 nm) was used for the multiphoton tomography. We applied this high-resolution imaging tool to visualize A1-R bacteria targeting the Lewis lung cancer cells growing subcutaneously in nude mice. The tomographic images revealed that bacterially-infected cancer cells greatly expanded and burst and thereby lost viability. Similar results were seen in vitro using confocal microscopy. The bacteria targeted the tumor within minutes of tail-vein injection. Using mice in which the nestin-promoter drives GFP and in which blood vessels are labeled with GFP, the bacteria could be imaged in and out of the blood vessels.

External signals regulate cytoskeletal dynamics and the cytoskeleton reciprocally modulates signal transduction, .

Our studies focus on differential induction of heart fate in the basal chordate Ciona intestinalis. We have found that differential induction does not simply reflect differential exposure to the inductive signal. Instead, pre-cardiac cells employ polarized, invasive protrusions to localize their response to an ungraded signal. Through targeted manipulation of the cytoskeletal regulator CDC42, we are able to de-polarize protrusive activity and generate uniform heart progenitor fate specification.

The change in the collagen structure as reflected in its SHG image is observed at length scales from submicron to hundreds of microns. We observed that heating the tendon below the temperature of 54 degrees C does not produce any change in the averaged SHG intensity. At the heating temperature of 54 degrees C and above, we find that increasing the heating temperature and time leads to decreasing SHG intensity. As the tendon is heated above 54 degrees C, the regions where the SHG signal vanish and form a tiger-tail like pattern. In addition, a decrease in the SHG signal occurs uniformly throughout the tendon. By comparing the relative SHG intensities in small and large areas, we found that the denaturation process responsible for forming the tiger-tail like pattern occurs at a higher rate than the global denaturation process occurring throughout the tendon. We also measured the fibril spacing and found that it remains constant at 1.61 +/- 0.04 micron for all heating temperature and times. The constant fibril density shows that the global denaturation process occurs at a length scale smaller than the size of the fibril.

Nevertheless, characterization of sub-wavelength structures in the far-field is possible using interferometric Fourier transform scatterometry (IFTS) combined with numerical simulation in a feedback loop.

However, those probes usually suffer from underisable photophysical/photochemical processes, such us blinking and photobleaching, limiting their utilization. The main challenges in fluorescent probe design are to improve their absorption/emission properties, and to provide higher stability against photobleaching. In the last few years, metallic nanoparticles (NPs) of various sizes, shapes, and compositions have been used as a new alternative for cellular microscopy. This is in part because \\u2013unlike common organic dyes and Qdots\\u2013 metallic NPs do not bleach or blink upon continuous illumination, are extremely stable, very bright, and their luminescence spans over the visible spectrum. These characteristics make them an attractive contrast agent for cell imaging both in vitro and in vivo. For these reasons, the emission of metallic NPs in bulk solutions has already been extensively characterized. In contrast with bulk experiments, where billions of molecules are measured simultaneously, single particle techniques allow the observation of characteristics and dynamical processes otherwise hidden in the measured average. A full understanding of the photophysical properties of the NPs is critical when they are used for single-molecule applications. Photophysical processes can be a source of artifacts if they are not interpreted accordingly and thus a careful characterization of these labels at the single particle level became crucial for the correct interpretation of the experimental results.

This technique allows in situ study of tissue specimens preserving important cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions. The imaging system was based on high-speed multiphoton microscopy (HSMPM) for 3D deep tissue imaging with minimal photodamage. Using appropriate fluorescent labels and a specimen translation stage, we could quantify cellular and biochemical states of tissues in a high throughput manner. This approach could assay tissue structures with subcellular resolution down to a few hundred micrometers deep. Its throughput could be quantified by the rate of volume imaging: 1.45 mm(3)/h with high resolution. For a tissue containing tightly packed, stratified cellular layers, this rate corresponded to sampling about 200 cells/s. We characterized the performance of 3D tissue cytometer by quantifying rare cell populations in 2D and 3D specimens in vitro. The measured population ratios, which were obtained by image analysis, agreed well with the expected ratios down to the ratio of 1/10(5). This technology was also applied to the detection of rare skin structures based on endogenous fluorophores. Sebaceous glands and a cell cluster at the base of a hair follicle were identified. Finally, the 3D tissue cytometer was applied to detect rare cells that had undergone homologous mitotic recombination in a novel transgenic mouse model, where recombination events could result in the expression of enhanced yellow fluorescent protein in the cells. 3D tissue cytometry based on HSMPM demonstrated its screening capability with high sensitivity and showed the possibility of studying cellular and biochemical states in tissues in situ.

Using Monte Carlo simulations, we assess the performance of both the double-exponential decay with known lifetimes and the double-exponential decay with unknown preexponential factors and lifetimes. Precision is evaluated as a function of the noise level (Poisson statistics), the ratios of the lifetimes, the ratios of their preexponential factors, and the fitting window. Optimum measurement conditions are determined. RLD is shown to work well over a wide range of practical experimental conditions. If the lifetimes are known, the preexponential factors can be determined with good precision even at low total counts (10(4)).

Yet, tissue- and cellular Ca2+ concentrations in physiologic and diseased states are only partially known, and difficult to measure. Prior observations on the Ca2+ distribution in skin were based on Ca2+ precipitation followed by electron microscopy, or proton-induced X-ray emission. Neither cellular and/or subcellular localization could be determined through these approaches. In cells in vitro, fluorescent dyes have been used extensively for ratiometric measurements of static and dynamic Ca2+ concentrations, also assessing organelle Ca2+ concentrations. For lack of better methods, these findings together build the basis for the current view of the role of Ca2+ in epidermis, their limitations notwithstanding. Here we report a method using Calcium Green 5N as the calcium sensor and the phasor-plot approach to separate raw lifetime components. Thus, fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) enables us to quantitatively assess and visualize dynamic changes of Ca2+ at light-microscopic resolution in ex vivo biopsies of unfixed epidermis, in close to in vivo conditions. Comparing undisturbed epidermis with epidermis following a barrier insult revealed major shifts, and more importantly, a mobilization of high amounts of Ca2+ shortly following barrier disruption, from intracellular stores. These results partially contradict the conventional view, where barrier insults abrogate a Ca2+ gradient towards the stratum granulosum.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the validator and the validation system (stereomicroscopy or radiography of tooth sections) on the outcome of diagnostic tests for occlusal caries. The material consisted of 60 extracted third molars which were serially sectioned (500-600 microns thick). Four observers examined the sections by two caries validation methods: stereomicroscopy and film radiography. The presence of caries in the occlusal surfaces of these teeth had previously been recorded by visual inspection and conventional film radiography. The kappa values for interobserver agreement within one validation method ranged from 0.44 to 0.76 for radiography and from 0.47 to 0.60 for microscopy. The intraobserver agreement with the two methods was low (range 0.31-0.49), and by cross-tabulating the data, it was found that the disagreements originated in a consistently deeper lesion score with stereomicroscopy than with radiography by all observers except 1. By use of receiver operating characteristic curve areas, little impact of the validation method was seen when visual inspection was validated (against microscopy mean area = 0.75, against radiography mean area = 0.74). The mean receiver operating characteristic area was higher when diagnostic film radiographs were validated against radiography (0.68) than against microscopy (0.63).

However, the heterogeneity of refractive indices of different substances in complex tissues like human skin can have a strong influence on CARS image formation and requires careful clinical interpretation of the detected signals. Interestingly, very regular patterns are present in the CARS images, which have no correspondence to the morphology revealed by autofluorescence at the same depth. The purpose of this paper is to clarify this phenomenon and to sensitize users for possible artefacts. A further part of this paper is the detailed comparison of CARS and autofluorescence images of healthy human skin in vivo covering the complete epidermis and part of the upper dermis by employing the flexible medical non-linear tomograph MPTflex CARS.', u'issn': u'1361-6560', u'number': u'17', u'month': u'sep', u'volume': u'60', u'pages': u'6881--6899', u'keyword': u'Humans, Microscopy, Fluorescence, Multiphoton, Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted, Computer Simulation, Epidermis, Skin, Tomography, Optical Coherence, Scattering, Radiation, Refractometry, Forearm, Spectrum Analysis, Raman, Dermis, Multimodal Imaging', u'year': u'2015', u'pmid': u'26305454', u'journal': u'Physics in Medicine and Biology', 'ID': 'weinigel_impact_2015'}\n",

We aimed to develop qFibrosis, a fully-automated assessment method combining quantification of histopathological architectural features, to address unmet needs in core biopsy evaluation of fibrosis in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients.\\nMETHODS: qFibrosis was established as a combined index based on 87 parameters of architectural features. Images acquired from 25 Thioacetamide-treated rat samples and 162 CHB core biopsies were used to train and test qFibrosis and to demonstrate its reproducibility. qFibrosis scoring was analyzed employing Metavir and Ishak fibrosis staging as standard references, and collagen proportionate area (CPA) measurement for comparison.\\nRESULTS: qFibrosis faithfully and reliably recapitulates Metavir fibrosis scores, as it can identify differences between all stages in both animal samples (p{\\\\textless}0.001) and human biopsies (p{\\\\textless}0.05). It is robust to sampling size, allowing for discrimination of different stages in samples of different sizes (area under the curve (AUC): 0.93-0.99 for animal samples: 1-16 mm(2); AUC: 0.84-0.97 for biopsies: 10-44 mm in length). qFibrosis can significantly predict staging underestimation in suboptimal biopsies ({\\\\textless}15 mm) and under- and over-scoring by different pathologists (p{\\\\textless}0.001). qFibrosis can also differentiate between Ishak stages 5 and 6 (AUC: 0.73, p=0.008), suggesting the possibility of monitoring intra-stage cirrhosis changes.

Because of this limitation, there is significant ongoing effort to develop alternative cancer screening and detection strategies for this population. This pilot study evaluates the potential of Diffuse Optical Spectroscopic Imaging (DOSI) to image known tumors in dense breast tissue.\\n\\nMethods\\nWe performed a retrospective analysis on 24 radiographically dense breast cancer subjects measured with DOSI over a four-year period (Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System - BI-RADS, category 3 and 4, average age = 39 \\xb1 7.6, average maximum size 31 \\xb1 17 mm). Two previously-described DOSI contrast functions, the tissue optical index (TOI) and the specific tumor component (STC), which are based upon the concentrations and spectral signatures of hemoglobin, water and lipids, respectively, were used to form 2D optical images of breast tumors.\\n\\nResults\\nUsing TOI and STC, 21 out of 24 breast tumors were found to be statistically different from the surrounding highly vascularized dense tissue and to be distinguishable from the areolar region. For these patients, the tumor to normal contrast was 2.6 \\xb1 1.2 (range 1.3 to 5.5) and 10.0 \\xb1 7.5 (range 3.3 to 26.4) for TOI and STC, respectively. STC images were particularly useful in eliminating metabolic background from the retroareolar region which led to identification of two out of four retroareolar tumors.\\n\\nConclusions\\nUsing both the abundance and the disposition of the tissue chromophores recovered from the DOSI measurements, we were able to observe tumor contrast relative to dense breast tissue.

Results were related to strength of adhesion and characteristics of cell adhesive contacts.\\nRESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: BPAEs responded to LPA by transmigration through gelatin- or collagen-coated filters, but not through fibronectin-, vitronectin-, or fibrinogen-coated filters. Fewer cells adhered to collagen or gelatin than to fibronectin in a static cell adhesion assay or after application of a g-force to detach cells. Video microscopy revealed that S1P stimulates large lamellipodia on two-dimensional fibronectin substrate. LPA stimulated lamellipodia on fibronectin, but the trailing edge remained attached, resulting in sting ray-shaped cells in video microscopy. LPA-treated cells on gelatin released the trailing edge. To understand how the extracellular matrix may regulate endothelial cell shape during movement, we surveyed changes in focal adhesion proteins. More Hic-5, a paxillin homolog, was detected in the detergent insoluble fraction of BPAEs attached to gelatin than fibronectin. No such difference was found in paxillin. In BPAEs, Hic-5 was localized to smaller punctate structures on fibronectin and longer, thinner focal adhesions on gelatin.

The current advances in fluorescence microscopy, coupled with the development of new fluorescent probes such as green fluorescent proteins, allow fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to be used to study protein interactions in living specimens.

Fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) microscopy and lifetime measurements are independent of change in fluorophore concentration or excitation intensity, and the combination of FRET and FLIM provides high spatial (nanometre) and temporal (nanoseconds) resolution. Because only the donor fluorophore lifetime is measured, spectral bleed-through is not an issue in FRET-FLIM imaging.

Specifically, we found that AM fungi acquired recalcitrant and labile forms of organic nitrogen. Moreover, N enrichment of soil reduced plot-scale uptake of these compounds. Since most plants host AM fungi, AM use of organic nitrogen could widely influence plant productivity, especially where N availability is relatively low.', u'issn': u'0038-0717', u'month': u'dec', u'volume': u'55', u'link': u'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3871874/', u'file': u'PubMed Central Full Text PDF:C\\\\:\\\\\\\\Users\\\\\\\\lociuser\\\\\\\\Zotero\\\\\\\\storage\\\\\\\\9Q3RKL52\\\\\\\\Whiteside et al. - 2012 - Organic nitrogen uptake by arbuscular mycorrhizal .pdf:application/pdf', u'year': u'2012', u'urldate': u'2017-11-23', u'pmid': u'24371363', 'ID': 'whiteside_organic_2012', u'journal': u'Soil biology \\\\& biochemistry', u'pmcid': u'PMC3871874'}\n",

We show that the conserved actin-binding I/LWEQ module at the C-terminus of Talin1 is necessary and sufficient for targeting to focal adhesion complexes. We also used truncation and site-directed mutagenesis to demonstrate that this novel targeting function correlates with, but is separable from, the actin-binding properties of the Talin1 I/LWEQ module.

Finally, we have demonstrated that the subcellular localization of the Talin1 I/LWEQ module is regulated by an intrasteric interaction with an upstream alpha-helix, suggesting that both the actin binding and adhesion-targeting elements are masked in full-length Talin1.

Here we show that mAbp1 localizes to dorsal ruffles and is necessary for platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-mediated dorsal ruffle formation. Despite their structural similarity, we find that mAbp1 and cortactin have nonredundant functions in the regulation of dorsal ruffle formation. mAbp1, like cortactin, is a calpain 2 substrate and the preferred cleavage site occurs between the actin-binding domain and the proline-rich region, generating a C-terminal mAbp1 fragment that inhibits dorsal ruffle formation. Furthermore, mAbp1 directly interacts with the actin regulatory protein WASp-interacting protein (WIP) through its SH3 domain. Finally, we demonstrate that the interaction between mAbp1 and WIP is important in regulating dorsal ruffle formation and that WIP-mediated effects on dorsal ruffle formation require mAbp1.

Homozygous fad24hi1019 larvae exhibit muscle degeneration accompanied by leukocyte infiltration. Muscle degeneration was extensive and included tissue apoptosis and disorganized, poorly striated muscle fibers. Blocking apoptosis using pan-caspase inhibitors resulted in decreased neutrophil recruitment into the body of the larva, suggesting a causative link between apoptosis and leukocyte infiltration.

Multiphoton microscopy offers several advantages over competing microscopy techniques: there is an inherent axial sectioning, penetration depths that compete well with confocal microscopy on account of the use of near-infrared light, and many two-photon contrast mechanisms, such as second-harmonic generation, have no analogue in one-photon microscopy. While the penetration depths of photons into tissue are typically limited on the order of hundreds of microns, this is of less concern in dermatology, as the skin is thin and readily accessible. As a result, multiphoton microscopy in dermatology has generated a great deal of interest, much of which is summarized here. The review covers the interaction of light and tissue, as well as the various considerations that must be made when designing an instrument. The state of multiphoton microscopy in imaging skin cancer and various other diseases is also discussed, along with the investigation of aging and regeneration phenomena, and finally, the use of multiphoton microscopy to analyze the transdermal transport of drugs, cosmetics and other agents is summarized.

Allergic rhinitis (AR), affecting about 20\\xa0\\\\% of the Canadian population, is an inflammatory disease characterised by a disequilibrium of T-lymphocytes and tissue eosinophilia. Aim of the present study was to describe distinct cytokine patterns in nasal secretion between seasonal and perennial AR (SAR/PAR), and healthy controls by comparing cytokines regulating T-cells or stimulating inflammatory cells, and chemokines.\\nMETHODS: Nasal secretions of 44 participants suffering from SAR, 45 participants with PAR and 48 healthy controls were gained using the cotton wool method, and analysed for IL-1\\u03b2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, IL-17, GM-CSF, G-CSF, IFN-\\u03b3, MCP-1, MIP-1\\u03b1, MIP-1\\u03b2, eotaxin, and RANTES by Bio-Plex Cytokine Assay as well as for ECP and tryptase by UniCAP-FEIA.\\nRESULTS: Participants with SAR or PAR presented elevated levels of tryptase, ECP, MCP-1, and MIP-1\\u03b2, while values of GM-CSF, G-CSF, IL-1\\u03b2, and IL-6 did not differ from the controls. Increased levels of IL-5, eotaxin, MIP-1\\u03b1, and IL-17 and decreased levels of IFN-\\u03b3, IL-12 and IL-10 were found in SAR only. RANTES was elevated in SAR in comparison to PAR. Interestingly, we found reduced levels of IL-4 in PAR and of IL-13 in SAR.\\nCONCLUSIONS: Elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines were seen in both disease entities. They were, however, more pronounced in SAR, indicating a higher degree of inflammation. This study suggests a downregulation of TH1 and Treg-lymphocytes and an upregulation of TH17 in SAR.

Calpains have been implicated in basic cellular processes including cell proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation. The focus of the current review is to summarize recent findings implicating calpains in cytoskeletal rearrangements and cell migration. Calpain cleaves many cytosolic proteins and therefore to be effective and limited in its scope, calpain activity has to be tightly regulated both temporally and spatially. Some mechanisms of regulation include calcium, growth factor-mediated phosphorylation and membrane targeting. Calpain inhibition reduces migration rates and inhibits cell invasiveness. Two putative mechanisms of calpain action during migration include its role as a signaling intermediate, acting upstream of Rho, and its effects on focal adhesion structure and disassembly. Therefore, calpains and downstream signaling molecules may be future targets for therapeutic interventions to treat cancer or chronic inflammation.', u'issn': u'1357-2725', u'number': u'7', u'month': u'jul', u'volume': u'34', u'pages': u'722--725', u'keyword': u'Cell Movement, Humans, Animals, Signal Transduction, Cytoskeleton, rho GTP-Binding Proteins, Models, Biological, Cell Adhesion, Calpain, Molecular Structure', u'year': u'2002', u'pmid': u'11950589', u'journal': u'The International Journal of Biochemistry \\\\& Cell Biology', 'ID': 'perrin_calpain_2002'}\n",

The clint1 mutants exhibit chronic inflammation characterized by increased Interleukin 1beta expression, leukocyte infiltration, bidirectional trafficking and phagocytosis of cellular debris. The defects in clint1 mutants can be rescued by expression of zebrafish clint1 and can be phenocopied with clint1-specific morpholinos, supporting an essential role for Clint1 in epidermal development.

To achieve high sensitivity the design has two detection channels. Bacteria are stained by two different nucleic acid dyes and excited with two different lasers.

The passage of a particle through the illumination volume is compared with a Gaussian pattern in both channels. The width of the Gaussian correlates with the time of passage of the particle so one particle is counted when the algorithm finds a match with a Gaussian in both channels.

All patients met high-urgency liver transplantation criteria.\\nINTERVENTIONS: Single-pass albumin dialysis was performed as rescue therapy for children with acute liver failure.\\nMEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The decrease in hepatic encephalopathy (grades 1-4) and the serum levels of bilirubin, bile acids, and ammonium were measured to assess the efficacy of detoxification. As a measure of liver synthesis function, thromboplastin time and fibrinogen were analyzed. The safety of the procedure was assessed by documenting adverse effects on mean arterial blood pressure, platelet count, and clinical course. Seven out of nine patients were bridged successfully to either native organ recovery (n = 1) or liver transplantation (n = 6), one of them twice. Six out of nine patients undergoing single-pass albumin dialysis (ten treatments) survived. In six patients, hepatic encephalopathy could be reduced at least by one degree. Ammonium, bilirubin, and bile acid levels decreased in all patients. One patient had an allergic reaction to albumin.\\nCONCLUSIONS: In childhood acute liver failure, treatment with single-pass albumin dialysis was generally well tolerated and seems to be effective in detoxification and in improving blood pressure, thus stabilizing the critical condition of children before liver transplantation and facilitating bridging to liver transplantation. It may be beneficial in avoiding severe neurologic sequelae after acute liver failure and thereby improve survival. Single-pass albumin dialysis is an inexpensive albumin-based detoxification system that is easy to set up and requires little training.

There are currently no established methods to obtain quantitative estimates of the density of adhesion ligands recognized by specific cell adhesion receptors.

We show that rotational flow stirs and suppresses precursor agglomeration in the core of the cilia-driven vortex. The velocity field correlates with the shape of the otolith and we provide evidence that hydrodynamics is actively involved in controlling otolith morphogenesis.

A.', u'language': u'eng', u'title': u'Physical and biochemical regulation of integrin release during rear detachment of migrating cells', 'ENTRYTYPE': u'article', u'abstract': u'Cell migration can be considered as a repeated cycle of membrane protrusion and attachment, cytoskeletal contraction and rear detachment. At intermediate and high levels of cell-substratum adhesiveness, cell speed appears to be rate-limited by rear detachment, specifically by the disruption of cytoskeleton-adhesion receptor-extracellular matrix (ECM) linkages. Often, cytoskeletal linkages fracture to release integrin adhesion receptors from the cell. Cell-extracellular matrix bonds may also dissociate, allowing the integrins to remain with the cell. To investigate molecular mechanisms involved in fracturing these linkages and regulating cell speed, we have developed an experimental system to track integrins during the process of rear retraction in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Integrin expression level was varied by transfecting CHO B2 cells, which express very little endogenous alpha5 integrin, with a plasmid containing human alpha5 integrin cDNA and sorting the cells into three populations with different alpha5 expression levels. Receptor/ligand affinity was varied using CHO cells transfected with either alphaIIbbeta3 or alphaIIbbeta3(beta1-2), a high affinity variant. alphaIIbbeta3(beta1-2) is activated to a higher affinity state with an anti-LIBS2 antibody. Fluorescent probes were conjugated to non-adhesion perturbing anti-integrin antibodies, which label integrins in CHO cells migrating on a matrix-coated glass coverslip. The rear retraction area was determined using phase contrast microscopy and integrins initially in this area were tracked by fluorescence microscopy and a cooled CCD camera. We find that rear retraction rate appears to limit cell speed at intermediate and high adhesiveness, but not at low adhesiveness. Upon rear retraction, the amount of integrin released from the cell increases as extracellular matrix concentration, receptor level and receptor-ligand affinity increase. In fact, integrin release is a constant function of cell-substratum adhesiveness and the number of cell-substratum bonds. In the adhesive regime where rear detachment limits the rate of cell migration, cell speed has an inverse relationship to the amount of integrin released at the rear of the cell. At high cell-substratum adhesiveness, calpain, a Ca2+-dependent protease, is also involved in release of cytoskeletal linkages during rear retraction. Inhibition of calpain results in decreased integrin release from the cell membrane, and consequently a decrease in cell speed, during migration. These observations suggest a model for rear retraction in which applied tension and calpain-mediated cytoskeletal linkage cleavage are required at high adhesiveness, but only applied tension is required at low adhesiveness.', u'issn': u'0021-9533', u'month': u'apr', u'volume': u'111 ( Pt 7)', u'pages': u'929--940', u'keyword': u'Cell Movement, Extracellular Matrix, Animals, Cytoskeleton, Integrins, Cell Adhesion, Cricetinae, Calpain, CHO Cells, Glycoproteins', u'year': u'1998', u'pmid': u'9490637', u'journal': u'Journal of Cell Science', 'ID': 'palecek_physical_1998'}\n",

The average brightness of the particle is obtained from the ratio of the variance to the average intensity at each pixel. To obtain the average number of fluctuating particles, we divide the average intensity at one pixel by the brightness. This analysis can be used in a wide range of concentrations. In cells, the intensity at any given pixel may be due to bright immobile structures, dim fast diffusing particles, and to autofluorescence or scattering. The total variance is given by the variance of each of the above components in addition to the variance due to detector noise. Assuming that all sources of variance are independent, the total variance is the sum of the variances of the individual components. The variance due to the particles fluctuating in the observation volume is proportional to the square of the particle brightness while the variance of the immobile fraction, the autofluorescence, scattering, and that of the detector is proportional to the intensity of these components. Only the fluctuations that depend on the square of the brightness (the mobile particles) will have a ratio of the variance to the intensity {\\\\textgreater}1. Furthermore, changing the fluorescence intensity by increasing the illumination power, distinguishes between these possible contributions. We show maps of molecular brightness and number of cell migration proteins obtained using a two-photon scanning microscope operating with a photon-counting detector. These brightness maps reveal binding dynamics at the focal adhesions with pixel resolution and provide a picture of the binding and unbinding process in which dim molecules attach to the adhesions or large molecular aggregates dissociate from adhesion.', u'issn': u'0006-3495', u'number': u'6', u'month': u'mar', u'volume': u'94', u'link': u'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2257897/', u'pages': u'2320--2332', u'file': u'PubMed Central Full Text PDF:C\\\\:\\\\\\\\Users\\\\\\\\lociuser\\\\\\\\Zotero\\\\\\\\storage\\\\\\\\83CZ4M43\\\\\\\\Digman et al. - 2008 - Mapping the Number of Molecules and Brightness in .pdf:application/pdf', u'year': u'2008', u'urldate': u'2017-11-23', u'pmid': u'18096627', 'ID': 'digman_mapping_2008', u'journal': u'Biophysical Journal', u'pmcid': u'PMC2257897'}\n",

BRAF mutational analysis was carried out by high resolution melting (HRM) analysis, pyrosequencing, allele specific PCR, next generation sequencing (NGS) and immunohistochemistry (IHC). All mutations were independently reassessed by Sanger sequencing.

In experiments in which the ECM density was systematically varied, STICS revealed that the rate at which ECs deformed individual ECM fibers on the microscale positively correlated with capillary sprouting on the macroscale. ECs expressing constitutively active V14-RhoA displaced individual matrix fibers at significantly faster rates and displayed enhanced capillary sprouting relative to wild-type cells, while those expressing dominant-negative N19-RhoA behaved in an opposite fashion. In parallel, AMR revealed a local stiffening of the ECM proximal to the tips of sprouting ECs.

In the main study, the presence/absence of the descriptors identified in the preliminary study was blindly evaluated on a test set, comprising 66 BCCs, 66 healthy skin samples and 66 skin lesions, including 23 nevi, 8 melanomas, 17 skin tumours and other skin lesions by 3 independent observers.\\nRESULTS: In the preliminary study, three epidermal descriptors and six descriptors for BCC were identified.

However, the relative contribution of local nerve contact versus secreted signals remains unclear. Here, we show a conserved (vertebrates to invertebrates) requirement for intact local nerves in airway branching, persisting even when cholinergic neurotransmission is blocked.\\n\\nResults\\nIn the vertebrate lung, deleting enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP)-labeled intrinsic neurons using a two-photon laser leaves adjacent cells intact, but abolishes branching. Branching is unaffected by similar laser power delivered to the immediately adjacent non-neural mesodermal tissue, by blocking cholinergic receptors or by blocking synaptic transmission with botulinum toxin A. Because adjacent vasculature and epithelial proliferation also contribute to branching in the vertebrate lung, the direct dependence on nerves for airway branching was tested by deleting neurons in Drosophila embryos. A specific deletion of neurons in the Drosophila embryo by driving cell-autonomous RicinA under the pan-neuronal elav enhancer perturbed Drosophila airway development. This system confirmed that even in the absence of a vasculature or epithelial proliferation, airway branching is still disrupted by neural lesioning.\\n\\nConclusions\\nTogether, this shows that airway morphogenesis requires local innervation in vertebrates and invertebrates, yet neurotransmission is dispensable. The need for innervation persists in the fly, wherein adjacent vasculature and epithelial proliferation are absent. Our novel, targeted laser ablation technique permitted the local function of parasympathetic innervation to be distinguished from neurotransmission.\\n\\nElectronic supplementary material\\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12915-014-0092-2) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.', u'issn': u'1741-7007', u'month': u'nov', u'volume': u'12', u'link': u'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4255442/', u'file': u'PubMed Central Full Text PDF:C\\\\:\\\\\\\\Users\\\\\\\\lociuser\\\\\\\\Zotero\\\\\\\\storage\\\\\\\\BDS59F7R\\\\\\\\Bower et al. - 2014 - Airway branching has conserved needs for local par.pdf:application/pdf', u'year': u'2014', u'urldate': u'2017-11-23', u'pmid': u'25385196', 'ID': 'bower_airway_2014', u'journal': u'BMC Biology', u'pmcid': u'PMC4255442'}\n",

The process involves scanning a 2D area and measuring fluorescence at a given tissue depth below the surface after excitation by a laser beam with a wavelength within the one-photon or two-photon absorption band of the fluorophores followed by the stacking together of a series of 2D images from different depths to reconstruct the full spatial structure of the sample.

Here we exploited the zebrafish system to study the role of microtubules in neutrophil migration in vivo. The localization of microtubules was visualized in motile neutrophils using various bioprobes, revealing that, in contrast to what has been seen in studies in vitro, the microtubule organizing center is positioned in front of the nucleus (relative to the direction of migration) in motile neutrophils. Microtubule disassembly impaired attraction of neutrophils to wounds but enhanced the polarity of F-actin dynamics as measured by the distribution of stable and dynamic F-actin. Microtubule depolymerization inhibited polarized phosphoinositol 3-kinase (PI(3)K) activation at the leading edge and induced rapid PI(3)K independent motility. Finally, we show that microtubules exert their effects on neutrophil polarity and motility at least in part by the negative regulation of both Rho and Rac activity.

The stereotypical patterns formed by two such proteins, Rho and Cdc42, around laser-injured frog oocytes permit experimental analysis of GTPase activation, inactivation, segregation and crosstalk. Here, we review the development and analysis of a spatial model of GTPase dynamics that describe the formation of concentric zones of Rho and Cdc42 activity around wounds, and describe how this model has provided insights into the roles of the GTPase effector molecules protein kinase C (PKC\\u03b2 and PKC\\u03b7) and guanosine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI) in the wound response. We further demonstrate how the use of a \\u2018sharp switch\\u2019 model approximation in combination with bifurcation analysis can aid mapping the model behaviour in parameter space (approximate results confirmed with numerical simulation methods). Using these methods in combination with experimental manipulation of PKC activity (PKC overexpression (OE) and dominant negative conditions), we have shown that: (i) PKC\\u03b2 most probably acts by enhancing existing positive feedbacks (from Rho to itself via the guanosine nucleotide exchange factor domain of Abr, and from Cdc42 to itself), (ii) PKC\\u03b7 most probably increases basal rates of inactivation (or possibly decreases basal rates of activation) of Rho and Cdc42, and (iii) the graded distribution of PKC\\u03b7 and its effect on initial Rho activity accounts for inversion of zones in a fraction (20\\\\%) of PKC\\u03b7 OE cells. Finally, we speculate that GDIs (which sequester GTPases) may have a critical role in defining the spatial domain, where the wound response may occur.

In this review, we will highlight the current understanding of the role of neutrophils in pediatric rheumatology, with a focus on juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and lupus.\\nRECENT FINDINGS: In inflamed tissues, neutrophils extrude neutrophil extracellular traps containing autoantigen that potentially drives lupus and rheumatoid factor-positive JIA. However, the contribution of neutrophil extracellular traps to pathogenesis remains an area of intense investigation. In JIA joints, neutrophils are activated to such an extent that associated circulating levels of S100A proteins may serve as biomarkers, correlating with disease activity, predicting response to treatment and heralding flares. Beyond the effects of 'normal' activation, neutrophils in JIA and lupus display dysregulation in gene expression, subset activation, and apoptosis.\\nSUMMARY: The role of neutrophils in pediatric rheumatology is an understudied area, but garnering increasing attention. Although clearly implicated in JIA and lupus, the specific contributions of neutrophils to pathogenesis and the use of neutrophil activity surrogates as biomarkers require further study.

Current methods are limited in their ability to meet the more demanding requirements for clinical applications. Because patient samples have a short lifespan and sometimes a limited volume (e.g. pediatrics), the operational requirements for an efficient chemotaxis assay are increased in the clinical setting. Here we describe a microscale assay platform for gradient generation that overcomes these limitations. Passive fluidic methods are leveraged to provide a reliable microfluidic gradient generation device, operable in only three pipetting steps. In addition, arrayed imaging and advanced cell tracking algorithms enabled a 50-fold increase in throughput over current methods. These methods were employed to aid in the diagnostic evaluation of an infant who presented with severe, recurrent bacterial infections. Analysis of the infant's neutrophils revealed impaired cell polarization and chemotaxis in a gradient of the chemoattractant fMLP. The patient was subsequently diagnosed with an inhibitory mutation in the Rho GTPase, Rac2. The approach also enabled a microenvironmental screen of human primary neutrophil chemotaxis on fibronectin, fibrinogen and laminin with results suggesting that fibronectin, although commonly used, may not be the most appropriate matrix protein for chemotaxis assays. Together, these findings demonstrate the use of arrayed micro-devices to aid in the diagnosis of a primary immunodeficiency disorder, and illustrate the capability for increased throughput microenvironmental studies and screening targeted to specific human diseases.\", u'issn': u'1757-9708', u'number': u'11-12', u'month': u'nov', u'volume': u'2', u'pages': u'630--638', u'keyword': u'Humans, Models, Biological, Equipment Design, Cell Polarity, Mutation, Neutrophils, rac GTP-Binding Proteins, Microfluidic Analytical Techniques, Chemotaxis, Leukocyte, N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine, HL-60 Cells, Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes, Cell Tracking, Immunologic Tests, In Vitro Techniques, Infant', u'year': u'2010', u'pmid': u'20953490', u'journal': u'Integrative Biology: Quantitative Biosciences from Nano to Macro', 'ID': 'berthier_arrayed_2010'}\n",

Wounds and tumours--a type of 'unhealed wound'--generate hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) through an NADPH oxidase (NOX). This extracellular H(2)O(2) mediates recruitment of leukocytes, particularly the first responders of innate immunity, neutrophils, to injured tissue. However, the sensor that neutrophils use to detect the redox state at wounds is unknown. Here we identify the Src family kinase (SFK) Lyn as a redox sensor that mediates initial neutrophil recruitment to wounds in zebrafish larvae. Lyn activation in neutrophils is dependent on wound-derived H(2)O(2) after tissue injury, and inhibition of Lyn attenuates neutrophil wound recruitment. Inhibition of SFKs also disrupted H(2)O(2)-mediated chemotaxis of primary human neutrophils. In vitro analysis identified a single cysteine residue, C466, as being responsible for direct oxidation-mediated activation of Lyn. Furthermore, transgenic-tissue-specific reconstitution with wild-type Lyn and a cysteine mutant revealed that Lyn C466 is important for the neutrophil wound response and downstream signalling in vivo.

TPM is a non-invasive imaging technique based on two-photon induced nonlinear excitations of fluorophores, with the capability for deep-tissue imaging (up to several hundred micrometers). The following aqueous solutions of surfactants, a humectant, and a surfactant+humectant mixture that contacted pig full-thickness skin (p-FTS) were studied: (i) a harsh surfactant solution-sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) (1 wt\\\\%); (ii) a harsh surfactant+humectant solution-SDS (1 wt\\\\%) + glycerol (10 wt\\\\%); (iii) a mild surfactant solution-sodium cocoyl isethionate (SCI) (1 wt\\\\%); (iv) a control solution-phosphate-buffered saline (PBS); and (v) a humectant solution-glycerol (10 wt\\\\%). Sulforhodamine B (SRB), a hydrophilic fluorescent probe, was used to visualize the effects of aqueous contacting solutions i-v on the skin barrier morphology. The results of the TPM visualization study revealed that SDS induces corneocyte damage by denaturing keratins and creating intracorneocyte penetration pathways. On the other hand, SDS+glycerol did not significantly induce corneocyte damage. The dual-channel TPM images corresponding to aqueous contacting solutions iii-v showed low SRB penetration into the corneocytes, as well as localization of the SRB probe within the lipid bilayers surrounding the corneocytes of the SC. Through a quantification of the amount of SRB that penetrated into the skin as a function of skin depth, we found that adding glycerol to an SDS aqueous contacting solution can significantly reduce the SDS-induced penetration depth of SRB, which provides evidence of the ability of glycerol to mitigate SDS-induced skin barrier perturbation. The distribution of SRB in the p-FTS samples was analyzed using a theoretical model that quantified changes in the skin aqueous pore characteristics induced by aqueous contacting solutions i, ii, iii, and v, relative to aqueous contacting solution iv, the control.

CaM and its target proteins form an integrated signaling network believed to be tuned spatially and temporally to control CaM's ability to appropriately pass signaling events downstream. Here, we report the spatial diffusivity and availability of CaM labeled with enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP)-CaM, at basal and elevated Ca2+, quantified by the novel fluorescent techniques of raster image scanning spectroscopy and number and brightness analysis. Our results show that in basal Ca2+ conditions cytoplasmic eGFP-CaM diffuses at a rate of 10 \\u03bcm2/s, twofold slower than the noninteracting tracer, eGFP, indicating that a significant fraction of CaM is diffusing bound to other partners. The diffusion rate of eGFP-CaM is reduced to 7 \\u03bcm2/s when a large (646 kDa) target protein Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase II is coexpressed in the cells. In addition, the presence of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, which can bind up to 12 CaM molecules per holoenzyme, increases the stoichiometry of binding to an average of 3 CaMs per diffusive molecule. Elevating intracellular Ca2+ did not have a major impact on the diffusion of CaM complexes. These results present us with a model whereby CaM is spatially modulated by target proteins and support the hypothesis that CaM availability is a limiting factor in the network of CaM-signaling enzymes.\", u'issn': u'0006-3495', u'number': u'12', u'month': u'dec', u'volume': u'95', u'link': u'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2599858/', u'pages': u'6002--6015', u'file': u'PubMed Central Full Text PDF:C\\\\:\\\\\\\\Users\\\\\\\\lociuser\\\\\\\\Zotero\\\\\\\\storage\\\\\\\\RFWPRKRC\\\\\\\\Sanabria et al. - 2008 - Spatial Diffusivity and Availability of Intracellu.pdf:application/pdf', u'year': u'2008', u'urldate': u'2017-11-23', u'pmid': u'18820232', 'ID': 'sanabria_spatial_2008', u'journal': u'Biophysical Journal', u'pmcid': u'PMC2599858'}\n",

However, current implementations of PTOCT require extensive temporal sampling, resulting in slow frame rates and a large data burden that limit its in vivo utility. To address these limitations, we have implemented optical lock-in techniques for photothermal optical lock-in OCT (poli-OCT), and demonstrated the in vivo imaging capabilities of this approach. The poli-OCT signal was assessed in tissue-mimicking phantoms containing indocyanine green (ICG), an FDA approved small molecule that has not been previously imaged in vivo with PTOCT. Then, the effects of in vivo blood flow and motion artifact were assessed and attenuated, and in vivo poli-OCT was demonstrated with both ICG and gold nanorods as contrast agents. Experiments revealed that poli-OCT signals agreed with optical lock-in theory and the bio-heat equation, and the system exhibited shot noise limited performance. In phantoms containing biologically relevant concentrations of ICG (1 \\xb5g/ml), the poli-OCT signal was significantly greater than control phantoms (p{\\\\textless}0.05), demonstrating sensitivity to small molecules. Finally, in vivo poli-OCT of ICG identified the lymphatic vessels in a mouse ear, and also identified low concentrations (200 pM) of gold nanorods in subcutaneous injections at frame rates ten times faster than previously reported.

The molecular basis for their anti-inflammatory effects is incompletely understood, but has been proposed to involve the indirect tethering of LXRs to inflammatory gene promoters. Here we demonstrate that the ability of LXRs to repress inflammatory gene expression in cells and mice derives primarily from their ability to regulate lipid metabolism through transcriptional activation and can occur in the absence of SUMOylation. Moreover, we identify the putative lipid transporter Abca1 as a critical mediator of LXR's anti-inflammatory effects. Activation of LXR inhibits signaling from TLRs 2, 4 and 9 to their downstream NF-\\u03baB and MAPK effectors through Abca1-dependent changes in membrane lipid organization that disrupt the recruitment of MyD88 and TRAF6.

However, increased inflammation has been linked to diseases such as obesity, diabetes and atherosclerosis (in which the walls of the arteries become hardened). These same diseases have also been linked to problems with the production or breakdown of fatty molecules, such as cholesterol., Transcription factors are proteins that bind to DNA to control gene expression. A transcription factor called LXR regulates the production and breakdown of cholesterol in response to changing levels of cholesterol in the body. LXR has also been shown to inhibit inflammatory responses, but previous studies suggested that these two actions of LXR are independent of each other., Ito et al. have now challenged these findings by showing that LXR inhibits inflammation via changes in the metabolism of cholesterol and other fatty molecules. The experiments used genetically engineered immune cells, called macrophages, and mice to show that activating LXR causes cholesterol molecules to move between the membranes in a cell. This in turn leads to changes in the signals sent by proteins found at the cell surface, and eventually to a reduction of inflammation responses., Future work will focus on better understanding the link between LXR's effects on metabolism and inflammation in models of human diseases such as diabetes and atherosclerosis., DOI:\\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08009.002\", u'issn': u'2050-084X', 'ENTRYTYPE': u'article', u'volume': u'4', u'link': u'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4517437/', u'file': u'PubMed Central Full Text PDF:C\\\\:\\\\\\\\Users\\\\\\\\lociuser\\\\\\\\Zotero\\\\\\\\storage\\\\\\\\XSAALN5S\\\\\\\\Ito et al. - LXRs link metabolism to inflammation through Abca1.pdf:application/pdf', u'urldate': u'2017-11-22', u'pmid': u'26173179', 'ID': 'ito_lxrs_nodate', u'journal': u'eLife', u'pmcid': u'PMC4517437'}\n",

B(max) and K(D) were 7.573 ng LDL/mg cell protein and 26.79 microg protein/mL (52 nM) for HepG(2) cells, respectively. Confocal microscopic images showed specific uptake of DiI-LDL throughout the cytoplasm in the B16/HepG(2) cells. Cryo-imaging demonstrated preferential accumulations of DiI-LDL in the viable tumor regions of both B16 and HepG(2) tumors compared with their adjacent normal tissues and corresponding necrotic tumor regions. In addition, uptake of DiI-LDL by the HepG(2) tumor was much higher than that of the B16 tumor, consistent with the fact that the probe binding affinity for LDLrs of HepG(2) cells is 2.3 times that of B16 cells.\\nCONCLUSION: This study suggested that carbocyanine labeled LDL could be used for optical imaging of tumors overexpressing LDLr.\", u'issn': u'1076-6332', u'number': u'6', u'month': u'jun', u'volume': u'11', u'pages': u'669--677', u'keyword': u'Humans, Animals, Mice, Neoplasms, Microscopy, Confocal, Mice, Nude, Tumor Cells, Cultured, Liver Neoplasms, Experimental, Lipoproteins, LDL, Receptors, LDL, Carbocyanines, Melanoma, Experimental', u'year': u'2004', u'pmid': u'15172369', u'journal': u'Academic Radiology', 'ID': 'li_carbocyanine_2004'}\n",

This regulation is linked to retrograde signals that transmit information on the metabolic state of the chloroplast to the nucleus. Transcripts of several APETALA2/ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR transcription factors (AP2/ERF-TFs) were found to respond within 10 min after transfer of low-light-acclimated Arabidopsis thaliana plants to high light. Initiation of this transcriptional response was completed within 1 min after transfer to high light. The fast responses of four AP2/ERF genes, ERF6, RRTF1, ERF104, and ERF105, were entirely deregulated in triose phosphate/phosphate translocator (tpt) mutants. Similarly, activation of MITOGEN-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE6 (MPK6) was upregulated after 1 min in the wild type but not in the tpt mutant. Based on this, together with altered transcript regulation in mpk6 and erf6 mutants, a retrograde signal transmission model is proposed starting with metabolite export through the triose phosphate/phosphate translocator with subsequent MPK6 activation leading to initiation of AP2/ERF-TF gene expression and other downstream gene targets.

NaPi-2b is regulated by changes in dietary Pi but the mechanisms underlying this regulation are largely undetermined. Sequence analyses show NaPi-2b has a PDZ binding motif at its C terminus. Immunofluorescence imaging shows NaPi-2b and two PDZ domain containing proteins, NHERF1 and PDZK1, are expressed in the apical microvillar domain of rat small intestine enterocytes. Co-immunoprecipitation studies in rat enterocytes show that NHERF1 associates with NaPi-2b but not PDZK1. In HEK co-expression studies, GFP-NaPi-2b co-precipitates with FLAG-NHERF1. This interaction is markedly diminished when the C-terminal four amino acids are truncated from NaPi-2b. FLIM-FRET analyses using tagged proteins in CACO-2BBE cells show a distinct phasor shift between NaPi-2b and NHERF1 but not between NaPi-2b and the PDZK1 pair.

The proposed EKF framework effectively models multiple-compartment and multiple-measurement systems in the presence of measurement noise and uncertainties in model dynamics. It provides simultaneous estimation of pharmacokinetic parameters and ICG concentrations in each compartment.

Here we show that the phospholipid remodeling enzyme lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 3 (Lpcat3) is a critical determinant of triglyceride (TG) secretion due to its unique ability to catalyze the incorporation of arachidonate into membranes. Mice lacking Lpcat3 in the intestine fail to thrive during weaning and exhibit enterocyte lipid accumulation and reduced plasma TGs. Mice lacking Lpcat3 in the liver show reduced plasma TGs, hepatosteatosis, and secrete lipid-poor very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) lacking arachidonoyl PLs. Mechanistic studies indicate that Lpcat3 activity impacts membrane lipid mobility in living cells, suggesting a biophysical basis for the requirement of arachidonoyl PLs in lipidating lipoprotein particles. These data identify Lpcat3 as a key factor in lipoprotein production and illustrate how manipulation of membrane composition can be used as a regulatory mechanism to control metabolic pathways., DOI:\\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06557.001, Living cells are surrounded by a membrane that forms a barrier between the cell and its external environment. This membrane is largely made up of a variety of molecules known as lipids. The particular lipid molecules found in a cell membrane strongly influence its mobility, flexibility and other physical properties., The liver and intestine can package lipids gained from the diet into molecules called lipoproteins, which are released into the bloodstream for use by the body. An enzyme known as Lpcat3 is found in high levels in the liver and intestine and it appears to be involved in the production of lipoproteins. Altering the amount of Lpcat3 in cells can change the types of lipids found in the cell membranes, connected to the production of lipoproteins., Rong et al. studied newborn mice that were missing the Lpcat3 protein in either the liver or intestine. Mice lacking Lpcat3 in the intestine had higher levels of lipids inside their intestine cells and grew more slowly than normal mice. Mice lacking Lpcat3 in the liver also accumulated lipids in their cells and their bloodstream had lower levels of lipids that contain a molecule called arachidonic acid than normal mice. Further experiments showed that the loss of Lpcat3 reduces the ability of lipids to move within the cell membrane., The experiments show that Lpcat3 plays a key role in attaching arachidonic acid to membrane lipids to promote the release of lipoproteins into the bloodstream. Rong et al.'s findings reveal that changing the type of lipids in the cell membrane plays an important role in regulating the levels of lipids in the blood., DOI:\\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06557.002\", u'issn': u'2050-084X', 'ENTRYTYPE': u'article', u'volume': u'4', u'link': u'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4400582/', u'file': u'PubMed Central Full Text PDF:C\\\\:\\\\\\\\Users\\\\\\\\lociuser\\\\\\\\Zotero\\\\\\\\storage\\\\\\\\3AREHQN2\\\\\\\\Rong et al. - Lpcat3-dependent production of arachidonoyl phosph.pdf:application/pdf', u'urldate': u'2017-11-22', u'pmid': u'25806685', 'ID': 'rong_lpcat3-dependent_nodate', u'journal': u'eLife', u'pmcid': u'PMC4400582'}\n",

Ambulatory and suspended animals underwent surgical rupture of their medial collateral ligaments, whereas sham surgeries were performed on control animals. After 3 or 7 wk, mechanical and/or morphological properties were measured in ligament, muscle, and bone. During mechanical testing, most suspended ligaments failed in the scar region, indicating the greatest impairment was to ligament and not to bone-ligament insertion. Ligament testing revealed significant reductions in maximum force, ultimate stress, elastic modulus, and low-load properties in suspended animals. In addition, femoral mineral density, femoral strength, gastrocnemius mass, and tibialis anterior mass were significantly reduced. Microscopy revealed abnormal scar formation and cell distribution in suspended ligaments with extracellular matrix discontinuities and voids between misaligned, but well-formed, collagen fiber bundles. Hence, stress levels from ambulation appear unnecessary for formation of fiber bundles yet required for collagen to form structurally competent continuous fibers.

Moreover, collagen-dense breast tissue increases the risk of breast carcinoma, although the relationship between collagen density and tumorigenesis is not well understood. As little is known about epithelial-stromal interactions in vivo, it is necessary to visualize the stroma surrounding normal epithelium and mammary tumors in intact tissues to better understand how matrix organization, density, and composition affect tumor formation and progression.\\nMETHODS: Epithelial-stromal interactions in normal mammary glands, mammary tumors, and tumor explants in three-dimensional culture were studied with histology, electron microscopy, and nonlinear optical imaging methodologies. Imaging of the tumor-stromal interface in live tumor tissue ex vivo was performed with multiphoton laser-scanning microscopy (MPLSM) to generate multiphoton excitation (MPE) of endogenous fluorophores and second harmonic generation (SHG) to image stromal collagen.\\nRESULTS: We used both laser-scanning multiphoton and second harmonic generation microscopy to determine the organization of specific collagen structures around ducts and tumors in intact, unfixed and unsectioned mammary glands. Local alterations in collagen density were clearly seen, allowing us to obtain three-dimensional information regarding the organization of the mammary stroma, such as radiating collagen fibers that could not have been obtained using classical histological techniques. Moreover, we observed and defined three tumor-associated collagen signatures (TACS) that provide novel markers to locate and characterize tumors. In particular, local cell invasion was found predominantly to be oriented along certain aligned collagen fibers, suggesting that radial alignment of collagen fibers relative to tumors facilitates invasion. Consistent with this observation, primary tumor explants cultured in a randomly organized collagen matrix realigned the collagen fibers, allowing individual tumor cells to migrate out along radially aligned fibers.\\nCONCLUSION: The presentation of these tumor-associated collagen signatures allowed us to identify pre-palpable tumors and see cells at the tumor-stromal boundary invading into the stroma along radially aligned collagen fibers. As such, TACS should provide indications that a tumor is, or could become, invasive, and may serve as part of a strategy to help identify and characterize breast tumors in animal and human tissues.', u'issn': u'1741-7015', u'number': u'1', u'month': u'dec', u'volume': u'4', u'pages': u'38', u'keyword': u'Animals, Collagen, Extracellular Matrix, Female, Mammary Glands, Animal, Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental, Mice, Microscopy, Confocal, Microscopy, Electron, Transmission, Neoplasm Invasiveness, Stromal Cells', u'file': u'Fulltext:C\\\\:\\\\\\\\Users\\\\\\\\lociuser\\\\\\\\Zotero\\\\\\\\storage\\\\\\\\824K627J\\\\\\\\1741-7015-4-38.html:text/html;Snapshot:C\\\\:\\\\\\\\Users\\\\\\\\lociuser\\\\\\\\Zotero\\\\\\\\storage\\\\\\\\C9QZD4SR\\\\\\\\1741-7015-4-38.html:text/html', u'year': u'2006', u'pmid': u'17190588', 'ID': 'provenzano_collagen_2006', u'journal': u'BMC medicine', u'pmcid': u'PMC1781458'}\n",

Here, using a pharmacological inhibitor of NADPH oxidases, diphenyleneiodonium (DPI), and genetic depletion of an epithelial-specific NADPH oxidase, we show that H(2)O(2) is not required for neutrophil detection of localized infection with the Gram-negative bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In contrast, PI3K signalling is required for neutrophil responses to both wounding and infection. In vivo imaging using a H(2)O(2) probe detects dynamic H(2)O(2) generation at wounds but not at infected tissue. Moreover, DPI no longer inhibits neutrophil wound attraction when P. aeruginosa is present in the media. Finally, DPI also fails to inhibit neutrophil recruitment to localized infection with the Gram-positive bacterium, Streptococcus iniae.

Here we apply a straightforward combination of live cell imaging, single-particle tracking microscopy, and quantitative transfection-efficiency assays on live cells to unveil the intracellular trafficking mechanism of Lipofectamine/DNA complexes. We find that Lipofectamine, contrary to alternative formulations, is able to efficiently avoid active intracellular transport along microtubules, and the subsequent entrapment and degradation of the payload within acidic/digestive lysosomal compartments. This result is achieved by random Brownian motion of Lipofectamine-containing vesicles within the cytoplasm. We demonstrate here that Brownian diffusion is an efficient route for Lipofectamine/DNA complexes to avoid metabolic degradation, thus leading to optimal transfection. By contrast, active transport along microtubules results in DNA degradation and subsequent poor transfection. Intracellular trafficking, endosomal escape and lysosomal degradation appear therefore as highly interdependent phenomena, in such a way that they should be viewed as a single barrier on the route for efficient transfection.

The results of differentiated measurements of changes in body composition during the Transeurope Footrace 2009 using a mobile whole body magnetic resonance (MR) imager are presented and the proposed influence of visceral and somatic adipose and lean tissue distribution on performance tested.\\nMETHODS: 22 participants were randomly selected for the repeated MR measurements (intervals: 800 km) with a 1.5 Tesla MR scanner mounted on a mobile unit during the 64-stage 4,486 km ultramarathon. A standardized and validated MRI protocol was used: T1 weighted turbo spin echo sequence, echo time 12 ms, repetition time 490 ms, slice thickness 10\\u2009mm, slice distance 10\\u2009mm (breath holding examinations). For topographic tissue segmentation and mapping a modified fuzzy c-means algorithm was used. A semi-automatic post-processing of whole body MRI data sets allows reliable analysis of the following body tissue compartments: Total body volume (TV), total somatic (TSV) and total visceral volume (TVV), total adipose (TAT) and total lean tissue (TLT), somatic (SLT) and visceral lean tissue (VLT), somatic (SAT) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and somatic adipose soft tissue (SAST). Specific volume changes were tested on significance. Tests on difference and relationship regarding prerace and race performance and non-finishing were done using statistical software SPSS.\\nRESULTS: Total, somatic and visceral volumes showed a significant decrease throughout the race. Adipose tissue showed a significant decrease compared to the start at all measurement times for TAT, SAST and VAT. Lean adipose tissues decreased until the end of the race, but not significantly. The mean relative volume changes of the different tissue compartments at the last measurement compared to the start were: TV -9.5\\\\% (SE 1.5\\\\%), TSV -9.4\\\\% (SE 1.5\\\\%), TVV -10.0\\\\% (SE 1.4\\\\%), TAT -41.3\\\\% (SE 2.3\\\\%), SAST -48.7\\\\% (SE 2.8\\\\%), VAT -64.5\\\\% (SE 4.6\\\\%), intraabdominal adipose tissue (IAAT) -67.3\\\\% (SE 4.3\\\\%), mediastinal adopose tissue (MAT) -41.5\\\\% (SE 7.1\\\\%), TLT -1.2\\\\% (SE 1.0\\\\%), SLT -1.4\\\\% (SE 1.1\\\\%). Before the start and during the early phase of the Transeurope Footrace 2009, the non-finisher group had a significantly higher percentage volume of TVV, TAT, SAST and VAT compared to the finisher group. VAT correlates significantly with prerace training volume and intensity one year before the race and with 50 km- and 24 hour-race records. Neither prerace body composition nor specific tissue compartment volume changes showed a significant relationship to performance in the last two thirds of the Transeurope Footrace 2009.\\nCONCLUSIONS: With this mobile MRI field study the complex changes in body composition during a multistage ultramarathon could be demonstrated in detail in a new and differentiated way. Participants lost more than half of their adipose tissue. Even lean tissue volume (mainly skeletal muscle tissue) decreased due to the unpreventable chronic negative energy balance during the race. VAT has the fastest and highest decrease compared to SAST and lean tissue compartments during the race. It seems to be the most sensitive morphometric parameter regarding the risk of non-finishing a transcontinental footrace and shows a direct relationship to prerace-performance.

We have previously demonstrated that netrin-1 dampens murine ALI, and in an attempt to advance this finding into future clinical practice we evaluated whether netrin-1 would reduce alveolar inflammation during porcine ALI.\\nMETHODS: This was a controlled in vivo experimental study in pigs. We induced ALI through lipoploysaccharide (LPS) infusion (50 \\u03bcg/kg) for 2 hours. Following this, we exposed animals to either vehicle, intravenous netrin-1 (netrin-1 i.v.) or inhaled netrin-1 (netrin-1 inh.). Serum samples and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were obtained to determine levels of tumor necrosis factor-\\u03b1 (TNF-\\u03b1), interleukin (IL)-1\\u03b2, interleukin-6 and interleukin-8 at baseline and 6 hours following treatment. Myeloperoxidase activity (MPO) and protein levels were determined in the BAL, and tissue samples were obtained for histological evaluation. Finally, animals were scanned with spiral CT.\\nRESULTS: Following LPS infusion, animals developed acute pulmonary injury. Serum levels of TNF-\\u03b1 and IL-6 were significantly reduced in the netrin-1 i.v. group.

MDCK cells and plasmid-only control transfectants, cultured in three-dimensional collagen type I gels, showed normal cyst formation, whereas the antisense RNA transfectants showed increased apoptosis and formed small rudimentary cysts. Stimulation with hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor-containing 3T3 fibroblast-conditioned medium or recombinant hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor resulted in extensive branching of the preformed control cysts whereas the surviving small cysts formed by antisense expressing cells increased in size but failed to elongate and branch upon stimulation. We conclude that alpha 2 beta 1 integrin collagen interactions play a crucial role in the hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor-induced tubulogenesis and branching morphogenesis of MDCK cells in collagen gels as well as an important role in cell survival.\", u'issn': u'0021-9533', u'month': u'nov', u'volume': u'108 ( Pt 11)', u'pages': u'3531--3540', u'keyword': u'Extracellular Matrix, Animals, Cells, Cultured, Integrins, Cell Survival, Cell Adhesion, Receptors, Collagen, Apoptosis, Morphogenesis, Transfection, Carrier Proteins, Cysts, Dogs, Hepatocyte Growth Factor, Kidney Tubules, Distal, RNA, Antisense', u'year': u'1995', u'pmid': u'8586664', u'journal': u'Journal of Cell Science', 'ID': 'saelman_loss_1995'}\n",

Neurochemical approaches focus on single neurotransmitters. Yet, there is an increasing realization that neural circuits operate at emergent levels, where the interactions between hundreds or thousands of neurons, utilizing multiple chemical transmitters, generate functional states.

We have previously demonstrated that the calcium-dependent protease, calpain, regulates the organization of adhesive complexes and cell detachment during cell migration. Evidence is now provided that inhibiting calpain through over-expression of the endogenous inhibitor of calpain, calpastatin, and pharmacological inhibitors results in an inhibition of adhesive complex disassembly with stabilization of GFP-vinculin and GFP/RFP-zyxin at the cell periphery. Calpain was also required for the microtubule-mediated turnover of adhesive complex sites after nocodazole wash-out, suggesting that calpain may mediate focal complex disassembly downstream of microtubules. Using dual imaging of RFP-zyxin and GFP-alpha-actinin, we observed a temporal and spatial relationship between alpha-actinin localization to focal contacts and the subsequent disassembly or translocation of RFP-zyxin containing focal complexes in areas of cell retraction. Calpain inhibition disrupted alpha-actinin localization to zyxin-containing focal contacts and focal complex disassembly or translocation to the cell center. In addition, disrupting alpha-actinin localization to focal complexes through expression of the alpha-actinin rod domain, but not the head domain, resulted in inhibition of focal adhesion disassembly similar to calpain inhibition.

TNF-alpha induces a stop signal that promotes neutrophil firm adhesion and inhibits neutrophil polarization and chemotaxis. Calpain is a calcium-dependent protease that mediates cytoskeletal reorganization during cell migration. Here, we show that calpain inhibition impairs TNF-alpha-induced neutrophil firm adhesion to fibrinogen-coated surfaces and the formation of vinculin-containing focal complexes. Calpain inhibition induces random migration in TNF-alpha-stimulated cells and prevents the generation of reactive oxygen species, but does not alter TNF-alpha-mediated activation of p38 MAPK and ERK MAPK. These findings suggest that the TNF-alpha-induced neutrophil arrest requires the activity of calpain independent of p38 MAPK and ERK signaling seen after TNF-alpha stimulation.

Here we show, with high-resolution time-lapse imaging of living mouse embryos, that mesodermal CE occurs by mediolateral cell intercalation, driven by mediolaterally polarized cell behavior. The initial events in the onset of CE are mediolateral elongation, alignment and orientation of mesoderm cells as they exit the primitive streak. This cell shape change occurs prior to, and is required for, the subsequent onset of mediolaterally polarized protrusive activity. In embryos mutant for PTK7, a novel cell polarity protein, the normal cell elongation and alignment upon leaving the primitive streak, the subsequent polarized protrusive activity, and CE and axial elongation all failed. The mesoderm normally thickens and extends, but on failure of convergence movements in Ptk7 mutants, the mesoderm underwent radial intercalation and excessive thinning, which suggests that a cryptic radial cell intercalation behavior resists excessive convergence-driven mesodermal thickening in normal embryos. When unimpeded by convergence forces in Ptk7 mutants, this unopposed radial intercalation resulted in excessive thinning of the mesoderm. These results show for the first time the polarized cell behaviors underlying CE in the mouse, demonstrate unique aspects of these behaviors compared with those of other vertebrates, and clearly define specific roles for planar polarity and for the novel planar cell polarity gene, Ptk7, as essential regulators of mediolateral cell intercalation during mammalian CE.', u'issn': u'0950-1991', u'number': u'12', u'month': u'jun', u'volume': u'136', u'pages': u'2039--2048', u'keyword': u'Cell Movement, Animals, Mice, Cell Polarity, Mutation, Embryo, Mammalian, Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases, Mesoderm, Body Patterning, Gastrulation', 'ID': 'yen_ptk7_2009', u'year': u'2009', u'pmid': u'19439496', u'journal': u'Development (Cambridge, England)', u'pmcid': u'PMC2685725'}\n",

Specifically, Cdc42 and Rac1 activation exhibits a biphasic dependence on fibronectin concentration that parallels optimum cell polarization and protrusion. In contrast, RhoA activity increases with increasing substratum concentration. We find that cross talk between Cdc42 and Rac1 is required for substratum-stimulated protrusion, whereas RhoA activity is inhibitory. We also show that Cdc42 activity is inhibited by Rac1 activation, suggesting that Rac1 activity may down-regulate Cdc42 activity and promote the formation of stabilized rather than transient protrusion. Furthermore, expression of RhoA down-regulates Cdc42 and Rac1 activity, providing a mechanism whereby RhoA may inhibit cell polarization and protrusion.

Previous work has reported that the calpain family of calcium-dependent proteases are important regulators of integrin activation and modulate T cell adhesion and migration.

CD4+ and CD8+ T cells developed normally in Capn4(F/F):CD4-CRE mice and had severely diminished expression of Calpain 1 and 2, diminished talin proteolysis and impaired casein degradation. Calpain 4-deficient T cells showed no difference in adhesion or migration on the LFA-1 ligand ICAM-1 compared to control T cells. Moreover, there was no impairment in conjugation between Capn4(F/F):CD4-CRE T cells and antigen presenting cells, and the conjugates were still capable of polarizing LFA-1, PKC-theta and actin to the immune synapse.

We have developed a new fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) technique, termed scanning FCS (i.e., SFCS), which performs multiple FCS measurements simultaneously by rapidly directing the excitation laser beam in a uniform (circular) scan across the bilayer of the GUVs in a repetitive fashion.

Scanning FCS measurements on GUVs allowed for a straightforward detection of spatial-temporal interactions between the protein and the membrane based on the diffusion rate of the protein. To test for protein incorporation into the bilayers of the GUVs, antibodies against one specific membrane protein (NaPi II cotransporter) were labeled with ALEXA-488. Fluorescence images of the GUVs in the presence of the labeled antibody showed marginal fluorescence enhancement on the GUV membrane bilayers (poor image contrast and resolution).

Many biological applications demand both high imaging speed and the ability to resolve multiple fluorophores. One of the successful methods to improve imaging speed in a highly turbid specimen is multifocal multiphoton microscopy (MMM) based on use of multi-anode photomultiplier tubes (MAPMT). This approach improves imaging speed by using multiple foci for parallelized excitation without sacrificing signal to noise ratio (SNR) due to the scattering of emission photons. In this work, we demonstrate that the MAPMT based MMM can be extended with spectral resolved imaging capability. Instead of generating multiple excitation foci in a 2D grid pattern, a linear array of foci is generated. This leaves one axis of the 2D MAPMT available for spectral dispersion and detection. The spectral-resolved MMM can detect several emission signals simultaneously with high imaging speed optimized for high-throughput, high-contents applications.

Existing dipole model for second harmonic generation, third harmonic generation and coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering assume that the dipoles which make up a scatterer do not interact with one another. Thus, this dipole model can be called the uncoupled dipole model. This dipole model is not sufficient to describe the effects of refractive index of a scatterer or to describe scattering at the edges of a scatterer. Taking into account the interaction between dipoles overcomes these short comings of the uncoupled dipole model. Coupled dipole model has been primarily used for linear scattering studies but it can be extended to predict nonlinear scattering. The coupled and uncoupled dipole models have been compared to highlight their differences.

The Cdc42 activity zone overlaps with dynamic F-actin, and is circumscribed by a RhoA-based actomyosin contractile ring. During cytokinesis, constriction of the RhoA contractile ring is accompanied by Cdc42-mediated membrane outpocketing such that one spindle pole and one set of chromosomes are pulled into the Cdc42 enclosure.

In this study, we demonstrate that integrin and cadherin receptors coordinately regulate contact-mediated inhibition of cell migration. In addition to promoting proliferation (Sastry, S., M. Lakonishok, D. Thomas, J. Muschler, and A. Horwitz. 1996. J. Cell Biol. 133:169-184), ectopic expression of the alpha5 integrin in cultures of primary quail myoblasts promotes a striking contact-mediated inhibition of cell migration. Myoblasts ectopically expressing alpha5 integrin (alpha5 myoblasts) move normally when not in contact, but upon contact, they show inhibition of migration and motile activity (i.e., extension and retraction of membrane protrusions). As a consequence, these cells tend to grow in aggregates and do not migrate to close a wound. This phenotype is also seen with ectopic expression of beta1 integrin, paxillin, or activated FAK (CD2 FAK) and therefore appears to result from enhanced integrin-mediated signaling. The contact inhibition observed in the alpha5 myoblasts is mediated by N-cadherin, whose expression is upregulated more than fivefold. Perturbation studies using low calcium conditions, antibody inhibition, and ectopic expression of wild-type and mutant N-cadherins all implicate N-cadherin in the contact inhibition of migration. Ectopic expression of N-cadherin also produces cells that show inhibited migration upon contact; however, they do not show suppressed motile activity, suggesting that integrins and cadherins coordinately regulate motile activity.

From a stack of camera images recorded in seconds, the type of dynamics such as free diffusion, flow or binding can be identified and quantified without being limited by current camera frame rates. Also, light exposure levels are very low and the image mean square displacement method does not require calibration of the microscope point spread function. To demonstrate the advantages of our approach, we quantified the dynamics of several different proteins in the cyto- and nucleoplasm of living cells.

Expression of wild type RACK1, but not RACK Y246F, was also able to rescue the adhesion and migration defects observed in the RACK1-deficient cells. Furthermore, our findings indicate that RACK1 functions to regulate paxillin phosphorylation and that its effects on paxillin dynamics require the Src-mediated phosphorylation of tyrosine 31/118 on paxillin. Taken together, these findings support a novel role for RACK1 as a key regulator of cell migration and adhesion dynamics through the regulation of Src activity, and the modulation of paxillin phosphorylation at early adhesions.', u'issn': u'0014-4827', u'number': u'12', u'month': u'jul', u'volume': u'313', u'pages': u'2667--2679', u'keyword': u'Cell Movement, Humans, Focal Adhesions, Phosphorylation, Cell Line, Enzyme Activation, Neoplasm Proteins, Proto-Oncogene Proteins pp60(c-src), Paxillin, Phosphotyrosine, GTP-Binding Proteins, Receptors, Cell Surface', 'ID': 'doan_rack1_2007', u'year': u'2007', u'pmid': u'17574549', u'journal': u'Experimental Cell Research', u'pmcid': u'PMC2679865'}\n",

However, high resolution molecular imaging has been limited to relatively shallow penetration depths that can be accessed with microscopy. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an optical analogue to ultrasound with relatively good penetration depth (1-2 mm) and resolution (approximately 1-10 microm). We have developed and characterized photothermal OCT as a molecular contrast mechanism that allows for high resolution molecular imaging at deeper penetration depths than microscopy. Our photothermal system consists of an amplitude-modulated heating beam that spatially overlaps with the focused spot of the sample arm of a spectral-domain OCT microscope. Validation experiments in tissuelike phantoms containing gold nanospheres that absorb at 532 nm revealed a sensitivity of 14 ppm nanospheres (weight/weight) in a tissuelike environment. The nanospheres were then conjugated to anti-EGFR, and molecular targeting was confirmed in cells that overexpress EGFR (MDA-MB-468) and cells that express low levels of EGFR (MDA-MB-435). Molecular imaging in three-dimensional tissue constructs was confirmed with a significantly lower photothermal signal (p{\\\\textless}0.0001) from the constructs composed of cells that express low levels of EGFR compared to the overexpressing cell constructs (300\\\\% signal increase).

In this study, we show that the cytoskeletal protein talin1 is required for TCR-mediated activation of LFA-1 through regulation of LFA-1 affinity and clustering. Depletion of talin1 from human T cells by small interfering RNAs impairs TCR-induced adhesion to ICAM-1 and T cell-APC conjugation. TCR-induced LFA-1 polarization, but not actin polarization, is defective in talin1-deficient T cells. Although LFA-1 affinity is also reduced in talin1-deficient T cells, rescue of LFA-1 affinity alone is not sufficient to restore LFA-1 adhesive function.

This paper reports studies of protein factor requirements for step 2 catalysis. The studies reveal that the only remodeling of the spliceosome between step 1 and step 2 is mediated by the DEAH-box ATPase Prp16., Step 2 catalysis of pre-mRNA splicing entails the excision of the intron and ligation of the 5\\u2032 and 3\\u2032 exons. The tasks of the splicing factors Prp16, Slu7, Prp18, and Prp22 in the formation of the step 2 active site of the spliceosome and in exon ligation, and the timing of their recruitment, remain poorly understood. Using a purified yeast in vitro splicing system, we show that only the DEAH-box ATPase Prp16 is required for formation of a functional step 2 active site and for exon ligation. Efficient docking of the 3\\u2032 splice site (3\\u2032SS) to the active site requires only Slu7/Prp18 but not Prp22. Spliceosome remodeling by Prp16 appears to be subtle as only the step 1 factor Cwc25 is dissociated prior to step 2 catalysis, with its release dependent on docking of the 3\\u2032SS to the active site and Prp16 action. We show by fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy that Slu7/Prp18 and Prp16 bind early to distinct, low-affinity binding sites on the step-1-activated B* spliceosome, which are subsequently converted into high-affinity sites.

Here, we show that the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ reuptake pump (SERCA) directs budding across germ layers and species. Clonal knockdown demonstrated a cell-autonomous role for SERCA in Drosophila air sac budding. Live imaging of Drosophila tracheogenesis revealed elevated Ca2+ levels in migratory tip cells as they form branches. SERCA blockade abolished this Ca2+ differential, aborting both cell migration and new branching. Activating protein kinase C (PKC) rescued Ca2+ in tip cells and restored cell migration and branching. Likewise, inhibiting SERCA abolished mammalian epithelial budding, PKC activation rescued budding, while morphogens did not. Mesoderm (zebrafish angiogenesis) and ectoderm (Drosophila nervous system) behaved similarly, suggesting a conserved requirement for cell-autonomous Ca2+ signaling, established by SERCA, in iterative budding., Summary: Dynamic imaging of living embryos demonstrates that SERCA is a conserved regulator that controls cell migration and branching across species and germ layers, and PKC activation can rescue SERCA inhibition.

However, none of these methods enables us to measure the diffusion of the fluorescent particle at each pixel of the image. Measurement using conventional single-point FCS at every individual pixel results in continuous long exposure of the cell to the laser and eventual bleaching of the sample. To overcome this limitation, we have developed what we believe to be a new method of scanning with simultaneous construction of a fluorescent image of the cell. In this believed new method of modified raster scanning, as it acquires the image, the laser scans each individual line multiple times before moving to the next line. This continues until the entire area is scanned. This is different from the original raster-scan image correlation spectroscopy approach, where data are acquired by scanning each frame once and then scanning the image multiple times. The total time of data acquisition needed for this method is much shorter than the time required for traditional FCS analysis at each pixel. However, at a single pixel, the acquired intensity time sequence is short; requiring nonconventional analysis of the correlation function to extract information about the diffusion. These correlation data have been analyzed using the phasor approach, a fit-free method that was originally developed for analysis of FLIM images. Analysis using this method results in an estimation of the average diffusion coefficient of the fluorescent species at each pixel of an image, and thus, a detailed diffusion map of the cell can be created.', u'issn': u'0006-3495', u'number': u'12', u'month': u'dec', u'volume': u'107', u'link': u'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4269802/', u'pages': u'2775--2785', u'file': u'PubMed Central Full Text PDF:C\\\\:\\\\\\\\Users\\\\\\\\lociuser\\\\\\\\Zotero\\\\\\\\storage\\\\\\\\W5CS8RKF\\\\\\\\Ranjit et al. - 2014 - Mapping Diffusion in a Living Cell via the Phasor .pdf:application/pdf', u'year': u'2014', u'urldate': u'2017-11-22', u'pmid': u'25517145', 'ID': 'ranjit_mapping_2014', u'journal': u'Biophysical Journal', u'pmcid': u'PMC4269802'}\n",

Nonlinear effects were previously observed in different frequency domains (low-frequency electric and magnetic fields and magnetization), but the high electric field strength afforded by lasers was necessary to demonstrate many nonlinear effects in the optical frequency range.

Subdividing the sample according to severity of AA, family history and age at onset, we detected lowest P-values for patients with the severe form of AA (Pcorr=0.036), with a positive family history (Pcorr=0.042) and with an age at onset{\\\\textless}or=20 years (Pcorr=0.048).\\nCONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest the R620W variant of PTPN22 as a general risk factor in AA with the strongest effect observed among patients with a severe type of AA, a positive family history or an early onset of disease.', u'issn': u'0007-0963', u'number': u'2', u'month': u'feb', u'volume': u'158', u'pages': u'389--391', u'keyword': u'Humans, Female, Male, Adolescent, Adult, Middle Aged, Child, Child, Preschool, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, Aged, Germany, Case-Control Studies, Aged, 80 and over, Alopecia Areata, Belgium, Polymorphism, Genetic, Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 22', u'year': u'2008', u'pmid': u'18028494', u'journal': u'The British Journal of Dermatology', 'ID': 'betz_r620w_2008'}\n",

The dynamics of PI(3)K products PI(3,4,5)P(3)-PI(3,4)P(2) during neutrophil migration were visualized in living zebrafish, revealing that PI(3)K activation at the leading edge is critical for neutrophil motility in intact tissues. A genetically encoded photoactivatable Rac was used to demonstrate that localized activation of Rac is sufficient to direct migration with precise temporal and spatial control in vivo. Similar stimulation of PI(3)K-inhibited cells did not direct migration. Localized Rac activation rescued membrane protrusion but not anteroposterior polarization of F-actin dynamics of PI(3)K-inhibited cells. Uncoupling Rac-mediated protrusion and polarization suggests a paradigm of two-tiered PI(3)K-mediated regulation of cell motility.

We tested this hypothesis in a rat medial collateral ligament (MCL) model. Fifteen animals were treated for 10 days with the sympathetic chemotoxin guanethidine using osmotic pumps, whereas 15 control rats received pumps containing saline. A reduction in plasma concentrations of norepinephrine in the guanethidine rats indicated a significant decrease in sympathetic nerve activity. Vasoactive intestinal peptide and neuropeptide Y were decreased in MCLs from guanethidine animals, as quantified by radioimmunoassays. Tissue vascularity was substantially increased in guanethidine MCLs, whereas mechanical properties were significantly decreased. Proteases, such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) and cysteine proteases, play a major role in ligament degradation. The proteases MMP-13, cathepsin K, and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) have collagenolytic activity and have been shown in rat ligament tissues. To determine whether the degradation seen in this study was due to protease activity, we determined the expression of these enzymes in control and treated MCLs. Real-time quantitative PCR revealed that guanethidine treatment increased expression of MMP-13 and cathepsin K mRNAs, although overall expression levels of MMP-13 and TRAP were relatively low.

Despite evidence demonstrating FAK overexpression in human cancer, its role in tumor initiation and progression is not well understood. Using Cre/LoxP technology to specifically knockout FAK in the mammary epithelium, we showed that FAK is not required for tumor initiation but is required for tumor progression. The mechanistic underpinnings of these results suggested that FAK regulates clinically relevant gene signatures and multiple signaling complexes associated with tumor progression and metastasis, such as Src, ERK, and p130Cas. Furthermore, a systems-level analysis identified FAK as a major regulator of the tumor transcriptome, influencing genes associated with adhesion and growth factor signaling pathways, and their cross talk. Additionally, FAK was shown to down-regulate the expression of clinically relevant proliferation- and metastasis-associated gene signatures, as well as an enriched group of genes associated with the G(2) and G(2)/M phases of the cell cycle. Computational analysis of transcription factor-binding sites within ontology-enriched or clustered gene sets suggested that the differentially expressed proliferation- and metastasis-associated genes in FAK-null cells were regulated through a common set of transcription factors, including p53.

Recently, lentiviral methods have enabled production of transgenic birds, including a transgenic Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica) line showing neuronal-specificity and stable expression of eGFP across generations (termed here as GFP quail). To test whether the GFP quail may serve as a viable alternative to the popular chicken model system, with the additional benefit of gene manipulation, we compared the development, organization, structure and function of a specific neuronal circuit in chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) to that of the GFP quail. This study focuses on a well-defined avian brain region, the principal nuclei of the sound localization circuit in the auditory brainstem, nucleus magnocellularis (NM) and nucleus laminaris (NL). Our results demonstrate that structural and functional properties of NM and NL neurons in the GFP quail, as well as their dynamic properties in response to changes in the environment, are nearly identical to those in chickens.

The aim of this retrospective observational ex vivo study, was to characterize melanoma both from a morphologic and a quantitative point of view, attaining an improvement in the diagnostic accuracy with respect to dermoscopy. In the training phase, thirty parameters, comprising both cytological descriptors and architectural aspects, were identified. The training set included 6 melanomas with a mean Breslow thickness\\xb1S.D. of 0.89\\xb10.48 mm. In the test phase, these parameters were blindly evaluated on a test data set consisting of 25 melanomas, 50 nevi and 50 basal cell carcinomas.

In this electrophysiological study, we used patch-clamp techniques to characterize the membrane properties of GG neurons. Our results offer evidence of functional heterogeneity in the GG. GG neurons fire spontaneously and independently in several stable patterns, including phasic and repetitive single-spike modes of discharge. Whole cell recordings demonstrated two distinct voltage-gated fast-inactivating Na+ currents with different steady-state voltage dependencies and different sensitivities to tetrodotoxin. Hodgkin-Huxley simulations showed that these Na+ currents confer dual mechanisms of action potential generation and contribute to different firing patterns.

The major damage mechanism during two-photon skin imaging is associated with the formation of cavitation at the epidermal-dermal junction, which results in thermal mechanical damage of the tissue. In this report, we verify that this damage mechanism is of thermal origin and is associated with one-photon absorption of infrared excitation light by melanin granules present in the epidermal-dermal junction. The thermal mechanical damage threshold for selected Caucasian skin specimens from a skin bank as a function of laser pulse energy and repetition rate has been determined. The experimentally established thermal mechanical damage threshold is consistent with a simple heat diffusion model for skin under femtosecond pulse laser illumination. Minimizing thermal mechanical damage is vital for the potential use of two-photon imaging in noninvasive optical biopsy of human skin in vivo. We describe a technique to mitigate specimen thermal mechanical damage based on the use of a laser pulse picker that reduces the laser repetition rate by selecting a fraction of pulses from a laser pulse train.

These techniques are limited by the number of wavelength points used to obtain FD data and by the sweeping technique used to collect FD data over a relatively large range. We have developed a method that introduces several improvements in the acquisition of optical parameters, based on the digital parallel acquisition of a comb of frequencies and on the use of a white laser as a single light source for both FD and SS measurements. The source, due to the high brightness, allows a higher penetration depth with an extremely low power on the sample.

Here we examine the electrical coupling between a nonmetallized field-effect transistor (FET) and a cell line expressing a voltage-gated EAG K+ channel. The activation kinetics of this channel depends on the voltage pulse protocol and extracellular divalent cations. This feature allows testing, whether the extracellular voltage signal recorded with the FET faithfully tracks the current simultaneously recorded with the patch-clamp technique. We find that the FET signals contain different kinetic components that cannot be entirely explained by equivalent electrical-circuit models. Rather, we suggest that changes in ion concentration in the small cleft between cell and FET may change the surface potential of the FET.

Activated Cdc42 enhanced p130(Cas) phosphorylation and its binding to Crk. Cdc42-driven migration and p130(Cas) phosphorylation were dependent on the Cdc42 effector Ack1 (activated Cdc42-associated kinase). Ack1 formed a signaling complex that also included Cdc42, p130(Cas), and Crk, formation of which was regulated by collagen stimulation. The interaction between Ack1 and p130(Cas) occurred through their respective SH3 domains, while the substrate domain of p130(Cas) was the major site of Ack1-dependent phosphorylation. Signaling through this complex is functionally relevant, because treatment with either p130(Cas) or Ack1 siRNA blocked Cdc42-induced migration. These results suggest that Cdc42 exerts its effects on cell migration in part through its effector Ack1, which regulates p130(Cas) signaling.', u'issn': u'0021-9258', u'number': u'49', u'month': u'dec', u'volume': u'281', u'pages': u'37527--37535', u'keyword': u'Cell Movement, Collagen, Humans, Signal Transduction, Female, Breast, Crk-Associated Substrate Protein, Phosphorylation, Cell Line, cdc42 GTP-Binding Protein, RNA, Small Interfering, Multiprotein Complexes, Protein-Tyrosine Kinases, Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-crk, Recombinant Proteins', u'year': u'2006', u'pmid': u'17038317', u'journal': u'The Journal of Biological Chemistry', 'ID': 'modzelewska_ack1_2006'}\n",

Autosomal dominant gain-of-function truncations of CXCR4 are associated with warts, hypo-gammaglobulinemia, infections, and myelokathexis (WHIM) syndrome, a primary immunodeficiency disorder characterized by neutropenia and recurrent infections. Recent progress has implicated CXCR4-SDF1 (stromal cell-derived factor 1) signaling in regulating neutrophil homeostasis, but the precise role of CXCR4-SDF1 interactions in regulating neutrophil motility in vivo is not known. Here, we use the optical transparency of zebrafish to visualize neutrophil trafficking in vivo in a zebrafish model of WHIM syndrome. We demonstrate that expression of WHIM mutations in zebrafish neutrophils induces neutrophil retention in hematopoietic tissue, impairing neutrophil motility and wound recruitment. The neutrophil retention signal induced by WHIM truncation mutations is SDF1 dependent, because depletion of SDF1 with the use of morpholino oligonucleotides restores neutrophil chemotaxis to wounds. Moreover, localized activation of a genetically encoded, photoactivatable Rac guanosine triphosphatase is sufficient to direct migration of neutrophils that express the WHIM mutation. The findings suggest that this transgenic zebrafish model of WHIM syndrome may provide a valuable tool to screen for agents that modify CXCR4-SDF1 retention signals.', u'issn': u'1528-0020', u'number': u'15', u'month': u'oct', u'volume': u'116', u'pages': u'2803--2811', u'keyword': u'Cell Movement, Humans, Animals, Signal Transduction, Animals, Genetically Modified, Disease Models, Animal, Zebrafish, Zebrafish Proteins, Amino Acid Sequence, Molecular Sequence Data, Mutation, Gene Expression, Neutrophils, Chemotaxis, Leukocyte, Agammaglobulinemia, Chemokine CXCL12, Hematopoiesis, Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes, Neutropenia, Receptors, CXCR4, Syndrome', 'ID': 'walters_live_2010', u'year': u'2010', u'pmid': u'20592249', u'journal': u'Blood', u'pmcid': u'PMC2974588'}\n",

The presence of seven MPT-FLIM descriptors was evaluated. The presence of seven RCM equivalent parameters was scored in accordance to their extension. Chi-squared test with Fisher's exact test and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient were determined between MPT-FLIM scores and adjusted-RCM scores.\\nRESULTS: MPT-FLIM and RCM descriptors of BCC were coupled to match the descriptors that define the same pathological structures.

In view of these opportunities, such organic coatings are widely used as ultrathin resists and functional films in micro- and nanofabrication [1\\u20135]. Nonlinear laser processing has evolved as a powerful and versatile means for nanopatterning of SAMs [6, 7]. Generally, laser processing is a maskless and flexible noncontact technique. Also, rapid processing over areas ranging from square centimeters to square decimeters can be carried out on essentially all kinds of support materials at high pressures and in liquids. In recent years femtosecond (fs) lasers have been proven to provide specific perspectives in nonlinear processing and sub-100 nm patterning of organic monolayers [7]. In particular, finely tuned photothermal reactions and multiphoton absorption processes introduce high nonlinearities [8, 9]. In addition, the ultrathin nature of these coatings allows single pulse processing, thus ensuring short processing times [7]. The molecular thickness also ensures well-defined irradiation and burr-free patterning and avoids the formation of bubbles and particles [8, 9]. All these issues represent common problems in ablative fs-laser processing [10, 11]. This chapter reviews recent progress in nonlinear fs-laser processing of organic monolayers, i.e. results from references [7\\u20139, 12\\u201315].

FLIM of autofluorescent reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate), NAD(P)H, has been previously exploited for label-free metabolic imaging of mammalian cells. However, NAD(P)H FLIM has not been established as a metabolic proxy in bacteria.

The bacterial phasor is sensitive to environmental conditions such as antibiotic exposure and growth phase, suggesting that observed shifts in the phasor are representative of metabolic changes within the cells.

In the present study of cellular adhesion, area was controlled by confining NIH 3T3 fibroblast cells to circular micropatterned islands of defined size. The shear moduli of cells adhering to islands of well defined geometry, as measured by magnetic microrheometry, was found to have a significantly lower variance than those of cells allowed to spread on unpatterned surfaces. We observe that the area of cellular adhesion influences shear modulus. Rheological measurements further indicate that cellular shear modulus is a biphasic function of cellular adhesion area with stiffness decreasing to a minimum value for intermediate areas of adhesion, and then increasing for cells on larger patterns. We propose a simple hypothesis: that the area of adhesion affects cellular rheological properties by regulating the structure of the actin cytoskeleton. To test this hypothesis, we quantified the volume fraction of polymerized actin in the cytosol by staining with fluorescent phalloidin and imaging using quantitative 3D microscopy. The polymerized actin volume fraction exhibited a similar biphasic dependence on adhesion area. Within the limits of our simplifying hypothesis, our experimental results permit an evaluation of the ability of established, micromechanical models to predict the cellular shear modulus based on polymerized actin volume fraction. We investigated the \"tensegrity\", \"cellular-solids\", and \"biopolymer physics\" models that have, respectively, a linear, quadratic, and 5/2 dependence on polymerized actin volume fraction. All three models predict that a biphasic trend in polymerized actin volume fraction as a function of adhesion area will result in a biphasic behavior in shear modulus. Our data favors a higher-order dependence on polymerized actin volume fraction. Increasingly better experimental agreement is observed for the tensegrity, the cellular solids, and the biopolymer models respectively. Alternatively if we postulate the existence of a critical actin volume fraction below which the shear modulus vanishes, the experimental data can be equivalently described by a model with an almost linear dependence on polymerized actin volume fraction; this observation supports a tensegrity model with a critical actin volume fraction.', u'issn': u'1556-5297', u'number': u'2', u'month': u'jun', u'volume': u'4', u'pages': u'87--104', u'keyword': u'Animals, Mice, NIH 3T3 Cells, Cytoskeleton, Biomechanical Phenomena, Magnetics, Models, Biological, Cell Adhesion, Actins, Fluorescent Dyes, Cell Size, Rheology', u'year': u'2007', u'pmid': u'17937113', u'journal': u'Molecular \\\\& cellular biomechanics: MCB', 'ID': 'su_geometric_2007-1'}\n",

We demonstrate this property on a series of dual and single chain biosensors which report the localization of Rac1 and RhoA activity, whilst performing concomitant ratiometric FRET analysis on the acquired FLIM data by the generalized polarization (GP) approach. We then evaluate and compare the ability of these two methods to quantitatively image biosensor FRET signal as a function of time and space. We find that with lifetime analysis in the phasor plot each molecular species is transformed into a two dimensional coordinate system where independent mixtures of fluorophores can be distinguished from changes in lifetime due to FRET. This enables the fractional contribution of the free and bound state of a dual chain biosensor or the low and high FRET species of a single chain biosensor to be quantified in each pixel of an image. The physical properties intrinsic to each biosensor design are also accurately characterized by the phasor analysis; thus this method could be used to inform biosensor optimization at the developmental stage.

FRET can be a very sensitive tool to study protein-protein and/or protein-nucleic acids interactions. RNA toxicity is implicated in a number of disorders; especially those associated with expanded repeat sequences, such as myotonic dystrophy. Myotonic dystrophy (DM1) is caused by a (CTG)n repeat expansion in the 3' UTR of the DMPK gene which results in nuclear retention of mutant DMPK transcripts in RNA foci. This results in toxic gain-of-function effects mediated through altered functions of RNA-binding proteins (e.g. MBNL1, hnRNPH, CUGBP1). In this study we demonstrate the potential of a new acceptor photobleaching assay to measure FRET (AP-FRET) between RNA and protein. We chose to focus on the interaction between MBNL1 and mutant DMPK mRNA in cells from DM1 patients due to the strong microscopic evidence of their co-localization. Using this technique we have direct evidence of intracellular interaction between MBNL1 and the DMPK RNA. Furthermore using the AP-FRET assay and MBNL1 mutants, we show that all four zinc-finger motifs in MBNL1 are crucial for MBNL1-RNA foci interactions. The data derived using this new assay provides compelling evidence for the interaction between RNA binding proteins and RNA foci, and mechanistic insights into MBNL1-RNA foci interaction demonstrating the power of AP-FRET in examining RNA-Protein interactions in DM1.\", u'issn': u'1932-6203', u'number': u'4', u'pages': u'e95957', u'volume': u'9', u'keyword': u\"Humans, Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer, Polymerase Chain Reaction, RNA, Messenger, RNA-Binding Proteins, 3' Untranslated Regions, Myotonic Dystrophy, Myotonin-Protein Kinase\", 'ID': 'rehman_development_2014', u'year': u'2014', u'pmid': u'24781112', u'journal': u'PloS One', u'pmcid': u'PMC4004549'}\n",

At the micron resolution, multiphoton imaging can provide both large morphological features and detailed structure of epithelium, corneal collagen fibril bundles and keratocytes. A large area multiphoton cross-section across an intact eye excised from a GFP mouse was obtained by a homebuilt multiphoton microscope. The broadband multiphoton fluorescence (435-700 nm) and second harmonic generation (SHG, 360-400 nm) signals were generated by the 760 nm output of a femtosecond titanium-sapphire laser. A water immersion objective (Fluor, 40X, NA 0.8; Nikon) was used to facilitate imaging the curve ocular surface. The multiphoton image over entire cornea provides morphological information of epithelial cells, keratocytes, and global collagen orientation. Specifically, our planar, large area multiphoton image reveals a concentric pattern of the stroma collagen, indicative of the laminar collagen organization throughout the stroma. In addition, the green fluorescence protein (GFP) labeling contributed to fluorescence contrast of cellular area and facilitated visualizing of inactive keratocytes. Our results show that multiphoton imaging of GFP labeled mouse cornea manifests both morphological significance and structural details. The second harmonic generation imaging reveals the collagen orientation, while the multiphoton fluorescence imaging indicates morphology and distribution of cells in cornea.

Regulation of VGSCs occurs at a hierarchy of levels from transcription to post-translation. Importantly, mainstream cancer mechanisms, especially hormones and growth factors, play a significant role in the regulation. On the whole, in major hormone-sensitive cancers, such as breast and prostate cancer, there is a negative association between genomic steroid hormone sensitivity and functional VGSC expression. Activity-dependent regulation by positive feedback has been demonstrated in strongly metastatic cells whereby the VGSC is self-sustaining, with its activity promoting further functional channel expression.

Fifty-two ligaments from 26 male rats were investigated. Eleven animals underwent surgical transection of both medial collateral ligaments (MCLs) (22 ligaments), which were allowed to heal for a period of 2 weeks. An additional 15 animals (30 ligaments) were used as normals. Ligaments were placed into six groups: Slack (n = 6 control, n = 6 healing), Reference (n = 4 control, n = 4 healing), Loaded (n = 4 control, n = 4 healing), 15 degrees Flexion (n = 4 control, n = 4 healing), 120 degrees Flexion (n = 4 control, n = 4 healing), and Tissue Strain vs. Flexion Angle (n = 8 normals). All ligaments, except those in the Tissue Strain vs. Flexion Angle group, were prepared for scanning electron microscopy. Tissues were harvested, mounted in a load frame, and chemically fixed in one of five states: (1). slack, (2). reference (onset of loading), (3). loaded, (4). 15 degrees knee flexion, or (5). 120 degrees knee flexion. After fixation the tissues were prepared for electron microscopy (SEM).

The results of a recent publication now demonstrate that, en route from resting cortex to fully established furrow, there lies a regime of cortical excitability in which Rho activity and F-actin play the roles of the prototypical activator and inhibitor, respectively. This cortical excitability is manifest as dramatic traveling waves on the cortex of oocytes and embryos of frogs and starfish. These waves are initiated by autocatalytic activation of Rho at the wave front and extinguished by F-actin-dependent inhibition at their back. It is still unclear how propagating excitable Rho-actin waves give rise to the stable co-existence of Rho activity and F-actin density in the static cleavage furrow during cytokinesis. It is possible that some central spindle-associated signaling molecule simply turns off the inhibition of Rho activity by F-actin. However, mathematical modeling suggests a distinct scenario in which local \\u201cre-wiring\\u201d of the Rho-actin coupling in the furrow is no longer necessary. Instead, the model predicts that the continuously rising level of Ect2 produces in the furrow a qualitatively new stable steady state that replaces excitability and brings about the stable co-existence of high Rho activity and dense F-actin despite the continuing inhibition of Rho by F-actin.', u'issn': u'2154-1248', u'number': u'2', u'month': u'apr', u'volume': u'7', u'link': u'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4905281/', u'pages': u'65--70', u'file': u'PubMed Central Full Text PDF:C\\\\:\\\\\\\\Users\\\\\\\\lociuser\\\\\\\\Zotero\\\\\\\\storage\\\\\\\\DCSL9QMI\\\\\\\\Goryachev et al. - 2016 - How to make a static cytokinetic furrow out of tra.pdf:application/pdf', u'year': u'2016', u'urldate': u'2017-11-23', u'pmid': u'27070950', 'ID': 'goryachev_how_2016', u'journal': u'Small GTPases', u'pmcid': u'PMC4905281'}\n",

We used live imaging in urchin and frog embryos to evaluate the relationship between microtubule organization and cytokinetic furrow position. In normal cells, the cytokinetic apparatus forms in a region of lower cortical microtubule density. Remarkably, cells depleted of astral microtubules conduct accurate, complete cytokinesis. Conversely, in anucleate cells, asters alone can support furrow induction without a spindle, but only when sufficiently separated.

Here we demonstrate that the LXR-responsive phospholipid-remodeling enzyme Lpcat3 modulates intestinal fatty acid and cholesterol absorption and is required for survival on a high-fat diet. Mice lacking Lpcat3 in the intestine thrive on carbohydrate-based chow, but lose body weight rapidly and become moribund on a triglyceride-rich diet. Lpcat3-dependent incorporation of polyunsaturated fatty acids into phospholipids is required for the efficient transport of dietary lipids into enterocytes. Furthermore, loss of Lpcat3 amplifies the production of gut hormones including GLP-1 and oleoylethanolamide in response to high-fat feeding, contributing to the paradoxical cessation of food intake in the setting of starvation. These results reveal that membrane phospholipid composition is a gating factor in passive lipid absorption, and implicate LXR-Lpcat3 signaling in a gut-brain feedback loop that couples absorption to food intake.,', u'issn': u'1550-4131', u'number': u'3', u'month': u'mar', u'volume': u'23', u'link': u'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4785086/', u'pages': u'492--504', u'file': u'PubMed Central Full Text PDF:C\\\\:\\\\\\\\Users\\\\\\\\lociuser\\\\\\\\Zotero\\\\\\\\storage\\\\\\\\W3C2T5AL\\\\\\\\Wang et al. - 2016 - Intestinal phospholipid remodeling is required for.pdf:application/pdf', u'year': u'2016', u'urldate': u'2017-11-22', u'pmid': u'26833026', 'ID': 'wang_intestinal_2016', u'journal': u'Cell metabolism', u'pmcid': u'PMC4785086'}\n",

There is mounting evidence suggesting that the connection between inflammation and lung cancer is not coincidental but may indeed be causal. The inflammatory molecules may be responsible for augmented macrophage recruitment, delayed neutrophil clearance and an increase in reactive oxygen species. The cytokines and growth factors unusually produced in chronic pulmonary disorders have been found to have harmful properties that pave the way for epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and tumor microenvironment. However, the role of inflammation in lung cancer is not yet fully understood.\\nAREAS COVERED: The role of chronic inflammation in the pathogenesis of lung cancer and some of the possible mechanisms involved, with particular focus on inflammatory mediators, genetic and epigenetic alterations, inflammatory markers, tumor microenvironment and anti-inflammatory drugs are discussed. A framework for understanding the connection between inflammation and lung cancer is provided, which may afford the opportunity to intercede in specific inflammatory damage mediating lung carcinogenesis and therapeutic resistance.\\nEXPERT OPINION: Advances in tumor immunology support the clinical implementation of immunotherapies for lung cancer.

Extension to other lipoproteins ranging in diameter from about 10 nm (high-density lipoprotein [HDL]) to over a micron (chylomicrons) is feasible. Loading of contrast or therapeutic agents onto or into these particles has been achieved by protein loading (covalent attachment to protein side chains), surface loading (intercalation into the phospholipid monolayer), and core loading (extraction and reconstitution of the triglyceride/cholesterol ester core). Core and surface loading of LDL have been used for delivery of optical imaging agents to tumor cells in vivo and in culture.

Ebola virus, which buds from the plasma membrane of the host cell, causes viral hemorrhagic fever and has a high fatality rate. To date, little has been known about how budding and egress of Ebola virus are mediated at the plasma membrane. We have found that the lipid phosphatidylserine (PS) regulates the assembly of Ebola virus matrix protein VP40. VP40 binds PS-containing membranes with nanomolar affinity, and binding of PS regulates VP40 localization and oligomerization on the plasma membrane inner leaflet. Further, alteration of PS levels in mammalian cells inhibits assembly and egress of VP40. Notably, interactions of VP40 with the plasma membrane induced exposure of PS on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane at sites of egress, whereas PS is typically found only on the inner leaflet. Taking the data together, we present a model accounting for the role of plasma membrane PS in assembly of Ebola virus-like particles., IMPORTANCE The lipid-enveloped Ebola virus causes severe infection with a high mortality rate and currently lacks FDA-approved therapeutics or vaccines. Ebola virus harbors just seven genes in its genome, and there is a critical requirement for acquisition of its lipid envelope from the plasma membrane of the human cell that it infects during the replication process. There is, however, a dearth of information available on the required contents of this envelope for egress and subsequent attachment and entry. Here we demonstrate that plasma membrane phosphatidylserine is critical for Ebola virus budding from the host cell plasma membrane. This report, to our knowledge, is the first to highlight the role of lipids in human cell membranes in the Ebola virus replication cycle and draws a clear link between selective binding and transport of a lipid across the membrane of the human cell and use of that lipid for subsequent viral entry.', u'issn': u'0022-538X', u'number': u'18', u'month': u'jul', u'volume': u'89', u'link': u'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4542376/', u'pages': u'9440--9453', u'file': u'PubMed Central Full Text PDF:C\\\\:\\\\\\\\Users\\\\\\\\lociuser\\\\\\\\Zotero\\\\\\\\storage\\\\\\\\82QZS96P\\\\\\\\Adu-Gyamfi et al. - 2015 - Host Cell Plasma Membrane Phosphatidylserine Regul.pdf:application/pdf', u'year': u'2015', u'urldate': u'2017-11-22', u'pmid': u'26136573', 'ID': 'adu-gyamfi_host_2015', u'journal': u'Journal of Virology', u'pmcid': u'PMC4542376'}\n",

The genetic tractability and the optical transparency of the early developmental stages of zebrafish allow for the generation and non-invasive imaging of transgenic lines with fluorescently tagged immune cells. The adaptive immune system is not fully functional until several weeks post fertilization, but zebrafish larvae have a conserved vertebrate innate immune system with both neutrophils and macrophages. Thus, the generation of a larval infection model allows the study of the specific contribution of innate immunity in controlling S. iniae infection. The site of microinjection will determine whether an infection is systemic or initially localized. Here, we present our protocols for otic vesicle injection of zebrafish aged 2-3 days post fertilization as well as our techniques for fluorescent confocal imaging of infection.

In such a dual imaging approach, while the correlation between optical and anatomical images may be high, it is not perfect. For example, a tumour may be present in the optical image, but may not be discernable in the anatomical image. The proposed hierarchical Bayesian approach allows incorporation of partial a priori knowledge about the noise and unknown optical image models, thereby capturing the function-anatomy correlation effectively. We present a computationally efficient iterative algorithm to simultaneously estimate the optical image and the unknown a priori model parameters.

Our novel approach is demonstrated by the enhanced temporal analysis of the three-dimensional cellular and extracellular deformations that accompany compressive loading of airway epithelial cells.', u'issn': u'1094-4087', u'number': u'16', u'month': u'aug', u'volume': u'16', u'pages': u'12403--12414', u'keyword': u'Humans, Mechanotransduction, Cellular, Algorithms, Imaging, Three-Dimensional, Epithelial Cells, Microscopy, Fluorescence, Multiphoton, Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted, Microscopy, Confocal, Cells, Cultured, Stress, Mechanical, Elasticity, Compressive Strength', 'ID': 'kojic_quantification_2008', u'year': u'2008', u'pmid': u'18679517', u'journal': u'Optics Express', u'pmcid': u'PMC2631567'}\n",

Photothermal OCT relies on the heat-producing capabilities of antibody-conjugated gold nanoparticles to achieve molecular contrast. A pump laser at the nanoparticle resonance wavelength is used to heat the nanoparticles in the sample, and the resulting changes in the index of refraction around the nanoparticles are detected by phase-sensitive OCT.

Very evident is the climate change, which has resulted in a southward shift of the climate zones, e.g. a spread of the desert (Sahara) into the Sahelian zone. After the drought period of the early 1970s and 1980s, livestock density increased resulting in an intensification of grazing pressure. This anthropogenous phenomenon leads to similar landscape changes as those caused by the climate. Only very few investigations exist on vegetation dynamics, climate changes and land use changes for the Sudanian zone. The paper presents data on changes of precipitation, of land use, of the geographical range of species, and of the composition of the flora, which have to be regarded as proofs of the sahelisation of large areas of the Sudanian zone.\\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Area of investigation: Burkina Faso. Precipitation data analysis: precipitation data from 67 stations; time series analysis and geo-statistical spatial interpolation. Analysis of land use change: Landsat satellite MSS and ETM+ data, acquired for two different dates between 1972 and 2001 analyzed by the software ERDAS/IMAGINE version 8.6 and ArcView 3.2 with the Spatial Analyst extension. Intensive ground truthing (160 training areas). Inventory of the flora: based on the data of the Herbarium Senckenbergianum (FR) in Frankfurt, Germany, and of the herbarium of the university of Ouagadougou (OUA), Burkina Faso, as well as on various investigations on the vegetation of Burkina Faso carried out in the years 1990 to 2005 by the team of the senior author. Life form analysis of the flora: based on the inventory of permanent plots.\\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Precipitation: Remarkable latitudinal shift of isohyets towards the South translates to a general reduction of average rainfall in great parts of the country. The last decade (1990-1999) shows some improvement, however, the more humid conditions of the 1950's and 1960's are not yet established again. Landcover change: In the study region the extent of arable fields and young fallows increased during the last 30 years from 580 km(2) in 1972 to 2870 km(2) in 2001. This means an average land cover conversion rate of 0.9\\\\% per year for the 6 departments considered. Change of the distribution of Sahelian and Sudanian species: Several species, mentioned in older literature as strictly Sahelian, today also occur in the Sudanian zone. Parallel to the spread of former strictly Sahelian species into the Sudanian zone, some former Sahelo-Sudanian species have withdrawn from the Sahel. Changes of the life form spectra of the flora: Considering their life form spectra, the flora of heavily grazed and of protected areas in the Sudanian zone show great differences. On areas intensively grazed the percentage of therophytes is evidently higher than on protected areas. Just the opposite is true for the phanerophytes. Their percentage is higher on the protected area than on the grazed zones. At the first glance, it is obvious to link the changes in flora and vegetation with the climate changes that have occurred during the last five decades (decrease of annual precipitation). However, not only climatic conditions have changed, but also population has increased, the percentage of land intensively used for agriculture and pasturing has increased and the time for soil regeneration today is much shorter than it was some decades ago. Thus, the landscape of the Sudanian zone has become a more Sahelian character. A comparison of the flora of an intensively used area of the Sudanian zone with that of a protected area shows a remarkable change in the life form spectra. The spectrum of the intensively used area is almost identical with that of the typical Sahelian flora. This comparison shows that the anthropogenic influence plays a greater role in the sahelisation of the Sudanian zone than the climate change.\\nCONCLUSION: Climate change and anthropogenic influence both, lead to a sahelisation of landscape and flora. Thus in many parts of the Sudanian zone of West Africa sahelisation phenomena will remain and even increase independently from the reestablishment of the more humid climate conditions of the 1950ies.\\nRECOMMENDATIONS AND PERSPECTIVES: In order to maintain some parts of the characteristic Sudanian landscape with its characteristic flora and vegetation, the number and size of protected areas should be augmented. For all protected areas it has to be ensured, that protection is reality, i.e. respected an understood by local people, not only fiction. As long as the enlargement of intensively used areas continues the sahelisation of flora, vegetation and landscape will continue too.\", u'issn': u'0944-1344', u'number': u'3', u'month': u'may', u'volume': u'14', u'pages': u'182--189', u'keyword': u'Humans, Animals, Africa, Western, Agriculture, Biodiversity, Climate, Geography, Homing Behavior, Rain', u'year': u'2007', u'pmid': u'17561777', u'journal': u'Environmental Science and Pollution Research International', 'ID': 'wittig_study_2007'}\n",

The dual-channel high-speed two-photon fluorescence microscopy studies presented here provide evidence for the existence of intracorneocyte diffusion in addition to the commonly cited lipid multilamellar transdermal pathway. The image quantification analysis methodology introduced in this paper reveals that intracorneocyte diffusion exists for the hydrophobic (rhodamine B hexyl ester) and for the hydrophilic (sulforhodamine B) model drugs, in the absence of oleic acid chemical enhancer action.

TE constructs were fabricated from decellularized porcine pulmonary valves, seeded ovine arterial cells and subsequent 16 days dynamic in vitro culture using a pulsatile bioreactor. Native and TE valves were studied by histology (hematoxylin-eosin, resorcin-fuchsin, Movat pentachrome), NIR femtosecond multiphoton laser scanning microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Cells of native and TE tissues were identified and localized by immunohistochemistry. Arterial, valvular and re-isolated TE-construct cells were processed for immunocytochemistry and Western blotting. ECM analysis and SEM revealed characteristical and comparable structures in native and TE leaflets. Most cells in native leaflets stained strongly positive for vimentin. Cells positive to alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), myosin and calponin were only found at the ventricular (inflow) side of ovine aortic and porcine pulmonary valve leaflets. Cells from TE constructs had a strong expression of vimentin, alpha-SMA, myosin, calponin and h-caldesmon throughout the entire leaflet. Comparable ECM formation and endothelial cell lining of native and TE leaflets could be demonstrated.

Despite the strong clinical correlation, breast density has not been causally linked to tumorigenesis, largely because no animal model has existed for studying breast tissue density. Importantly, regions of high breast density are associated with increased stromal collagen. Thus, the influence of the extracellular matrix on breast carcinoma development and the underlying molecular mechanisms are not understood.\\nMETHODS: To study the effects of collagen density on mammary tumor formation and progression, we utilized a bi-transgenic tumor model with increased stromal collagen in mouse mammary tissue. Imaging of the tumors and tumor-stromal interface in live tumor tissue was performed with multiphoton laser-scanning microscopy to generate multiphoton excitation and spectrally resolved fluorescent lifetimes of endogenous fluorophores. Second harmonic generation was utilized to image stromal collagen.\\nRESULTS: Herein we demonstrate that increased stromal collagen in mouse mammary tissue significantly increases tumor formation approximately three-fold (p {\\\\textless} 0.00001) and results in a significantly more invasive phenotype with approximately three times more lung metastasis (p {\\\\textless} 0.05). Furthermore, the increased invasive phenotype of tumor cells that arose within collagen-dense mammary tissues remains after tumor explants are cultured within reconstituted three-dimensional collagen gels. To better understand this behavior we imaged live tumors using nonlinear optical imaging approaches to demonstrate that local invasion is facilitated by stromal collagen re-organization and that this behavior is significantly increased in collagen-dense tissues. In addition, using multiphoton fluorescence and spectral lifetime imaging we identify a metabolic signature for flavin adenine dinucleotide, with increased fluorescent intensity and lifetime, in invading metastatic cells.\\nCONCLUSION: This study provides the first data causally linking increased stromal collagen to mammary tumor formation and metastasis, and demonstrates that fundamental differences arise and persist in epithelial tumor cells that progressed within collagen-dense microenvironments.

The radius of the orbits is half of the x,y-width of the point spread function, and the distance between the z planes is the z-width of the point spread function. The z-position is adjusted by moving the objective with a piezoelectric-nanopositioner. The particle position is calculated on the fly from the intensity profile obtained during the cycle, and these coordinates are used to set the scanning center for the next cycle.

Moreover, we demonstrate that matrix reorganization is contractility-dependent and that the Rho/Rho kinase pathway is necessary for collagen alignment to provide contact guidance.

The optical sectioning arises because this method takes a pulsed input beam, stretches the pulses by diffracting off a grating, and focuses the stretched pulses such that only at the focal plane are the pulses re-compressed. This approach generates nonlinear optical processes at the focal plane and results in depth discrimination. Prior theoretical models of temporal focusing processes approximate the contributions of the different spectral components by their mean. This is valid for longer pulses that have narrower spectral bandwidth but results in a systematic deviation when broad spectrum, femtosecond pulses are used. Further, prior model takes the paraxial approximation but since these pulses are focused with high numerical aperture (NA) objectives, the effects of the vectorial nature of light should be considered. In this paper we present a paraxial and a vector theory of temporal focusing that takes into account the finite spread of the spectrum. Using paraxial theory we arrive at an analytical solution to the electric field at the focus for temporally focused wide-field two-photon (TF2p) microscopy as well as in the case of a spectrally chirped input beam. We find that using paraxial theory while accounting for the broad spectral spread gives results almost twice vector theory. Experiment results agree with predictions of the vector theory giving an axial full-width half maximum (FWHM) of 2.1 \\u03bcmand1.8 \\u03bcmrespectively as long as spectral spread is taken into account. Using our system parameters, the optical sectioning of the TF2p microscope is found to be 8 \\u03bcm.

Measurements were performed on the internal side of the forearm before starting the treatment (T0), after 4 week (T4) and 12 weeks (T12) treatment. Measurements consisted of a multi-layers acquisitions using a multiphoton tomograph with subcellular resolution. Optical sections (about 6 microm thick) were recorded from 0 to about 200 microm using two different wavelengths: 760 and 820 nm. To compare the series of images and obtain an objective quantification of the signal of second harmonic generation (SHG) and autofluorescence, the method used consisted of taking the integrated brightness of an image (same rectangular area for all images) as a measure of the signal. Following this step, a ratio between brightness of images from the area treated with cream A or B and brightness of untreated area was calculated and used as an assessment of treatment efficacy. The parameter used for statistical analysis (variance analysis) is the difference before and after 12 weeks of treatment by either cream A or B of the signal ratios calculated in the upper dermis (118-130 microm) and those from a deeper region of the upper dermis (165-178 microm).\\nRESULTS: Signals (autofluorescence+SHG) of extracellular matrix do not change significantly with time (weeks 0, 4 and 12) when cream A (vehicle with no active ingredient) is applied. Treatment with cream B results in an enhancement in the signal level of extracellular matrix at week 12. The comparison of signals, in both areas (118-130 microm and 160-178 microm), show an higher increase in the deeper region than in the more superficial one for product B while we do not notice any change with product A.\\nCONCLUSION: The multiphoton tomograph provided excellent high-resolution images, which describe clearly the different skin layers, single cells and extracellular matrix components in all the 24 volunteers. Statistic analyses reveal a real effect for product B with selected plant extracts, known to increase collagen synthesis.

The photoluminescence of C-dots@RGO is quenched by MB, which is restored in the presence of a target DNA. The combination of the C-dots@RGO, MB, and a DNA probe is selective for perfectly matched DNA over mismatched DNA, mainly because relative to single-stranded DNA, double-stranded DNA intercalates more strongly with MB, but interacts more weakly with RGO. In the presence of a target DNA, MB intercalates with the as-formed double-stranded DNA and is released from the surface of C-dots@RGO, leading to \"turn-on\" photoluminescence.

Here, we report both host and bacterial determinants leading to the formation of organized macrophage aggregates as part of the host inflammatory response in a subset of infected larvae.

Macrophage aggregation coincided with NF\\u03baB activity, and the formation of these aggregates is mediated by leukotriene B4 (LTB4) produced by neutrophils. Depletion, inhibition, or genetic deletion of leukotriene A4 hydrolase (Lta4h), which catalyzes the last step in LTB4 synthesis, resulted in the absence of macrophage aggregation. Larvae with impaired neutrophil function also had impaired macrophage aggregation; however, aggregate formation was partially rescued with the addition of exogenous LTB4. Neutrophil-specific expression of lta4h was sufficient to rescue macrophage aggregation in Lta4h-deficient larvae and increased host survival following infection.

The microfluidic platform allows the identification of metabolites inhibiting neutrophil recruitment with as little as several nano-grams of compound in microliters of fluid.

However, the effects of cigarette smoking on underlying brain activity in smokers with ADHD are not well characterized. Non-invasive Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) was used to characterize how cigarette smoking affects prefrontal brain hemodynamics in smokers with and without ADHD. Prefrontal changes of oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin (HbO2 and HHb) were measured in six male adult smokers with ADHD and six age- and gender-matched control smokers. NIRS measurements were separated into four sequential time intervals, i.e., before smoking, during smoking, after smoking, and during a breath hold. Prefrontal HbO2 was lower during smoking in smokers with ADHD compared to control smokers. More specifically, smokers with ADHD showed decreased prefrontal HbO2 during smoking compared to breath hold, before and after smoking periods. In contrast, control smokers showed increased prefrontal HbO2 from before smoking to breath hold. Decreased prefrontal HbO2 in smokers with ADHD may reflect a smoking-induced change in prefrontal brain activity and microvasculature, which is not found in smokers without ADHD. The lower prefrontal HbO2 may be a biomarker for increased susceptibility to tobacco smoke in smokers with ADHD. Smoking in individuals with ADHD may increase vasoconstriction of cerebral arteries in the prefrontal cortex, which may contribute to a reduction in HbO2.

Modification included stimulation with a fixed low dose of calcium gluconate, additional stimulation in the distal splenic artery, and no insulin sampling in the left hepatic vein.\\nMETHODS: In 10 patients showing biochemical evidence of organic hyperinsulinemia, 0.45 mmol of Ca2+ was injected into the gastroduodenal, superior mesenteric, proper hepatic, proximal, and distal splenic arteries during angiography. Insulin levels were measured in samples taken from the right hepatic vein before and 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, and 300 s after Ca2+ injection.\\nRESULTS: Insulin gradients with an increase of more than fourfold indicated direct tumor supply, two- to fourfold correlated with collateral supply, and less than twofold correlated with normal tissue vascularization. ASVS localized all the adenomas of the pancreatic head (n = 3) and body (n = 2) and two of four adenomas of the tail correctly, as confirmed by surgery. Two adenomas of the proximal pancreatic tail were erroneously localized to the body segment, but the fault was rectified by angiography. In one patient with a negative ASVS and without exploration, the diagnosis of an insulinoma was revised.\\nCONCLUSION: ASVS with a fixed low dose of calcium gluconate is a highly accurate and safe method for preoperative localization of insulinomas.

PCO AG recently released the first luminescence lifetime imaging camera based on a high frequency modulated CMOS image sensor, QMFLIM2. Here we tested and provide operational procedures to calibrate the camera and to improve the accuracy using corrections necessary for image analysis. With its flexible input/output options, we are able to use a modulated laser diode or a 20MHz pulsed white supercontinuum laser as the light source. The output of the camera consists of a stack of modulated images that can be analyzed by the SimFCS software using the phasor approach. The non-uniform system response across the image sensor must be calibrated at the pixel level. This pixel calibration is crucial and needed for every camera settings, e.g. modulation frequency and exposure time. A significant dependency of the modulation signal on the intensity was also observed and hence an additional calibration is needed for each pixel depending on the pixel intensity level. These corrections are important not only for the fundamental frequency, but also for the higher harmonics when using the pulsed supercontinuum laser.

We studied the effect of pressure on the lateral organization and morphology of the model raft system DOPC (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine)/sphingomyelin/cholesterol as well as of the fluid mixture POPC (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine)/DLPC (1,2-dilauroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) by two-photon excitation fluorescence microscopy. The pressure-dependent experiments were carried out using a sample cell made from a thin fused silica capillary. The use of Laurdan as fluorescence label allowed us to also follow the lipid phase state by calculating the generalized polarization (GP) values of the vesicles and extracting their average value. During the compression cycle, a reduction in the volume of the vesicles is observed, accompanied by an increase of the average GP value, indicating an increasingly tighter packing of the lipids. Interestingly, the two systems studied show phenomena of budding and fission, and these at surprisingly low pressures of 200\\u2013300 bar. Moreover, these budding processes are not directly related to phase transitions to an overall ordered conformational state of the lipid membrane, which occur at much higher pressures. The topological changes of the lipid vesicles are irreversible and exhibit a different behavior depending on whether the pressure is increased or decreased.

In activated Xenopus eggs, exocytosing cortical granules (CGs) are surrounded by actin \\u201ccoats,\\u201d which compress the exocytosing compartments, resulting in compensatory endocytosis. Here, we examined the roles of two myosins in actin coat compression. Myosin-2 is recruited to exocytosing CGs late in coat compression. Inhibition of myosin-2 slows coat compression without affecting actin assembly. This differs from phenotype induced by inhibition of actin assembly, where exocytosing CGs are trapped at the plasma membrane (PM) completely. Thus, coat compression is likely driven in part by actin assembly itself, but it requires myosin-2 for efficient completion. In contrast to myosin-2, the long-tailed myosin-1e is recruited to exocytosing CGs immediately after egg activation. Perturbation of myosin-1e results in partial actin coat assembly and induces CG collapse into the PM. Intriguingly, simultaneous inhibition of actin assembly and myosin-1e prevents CG collapse.

High-speed microscopy reveals this process and shows that resealing is accompanied by intracellular patterning of proteins, ions, and membrane lipids., Cells rapidly reseal after damage, but how they do so is unknown. It has been hypothesized that resealing occurs due to formation of a patch derived from rapid fusion of intracellular compartments at the wound site. However, patching has never been directly visualized. Here we study membrane dynamics in wounded Xenopus laevis oocytes at high spatiotemporal resolution. Consistent with the patch hypothesis, we find that damage triggers rampant fusion of intracellular compartments, generating a barrier that limits influx of extracellular dextrans. Patch formation is accompanied by compound exocytosis, local accumulation and aggregation of vesicles, and rupture of compartments facing the external environment. Subcellular patterning is evident as annexin A1, dysferlin, diacylglycerol, active Rho, and active Cdc42 are recruited to compartments confined to different regions around the wound. We also find that a ring of elevated intracellular calcium overlaps the region where membrane dynamics are most evident and persists for several minutes. The results provide the first direct visualization of membrane patching during membrane repair, reveal novel features of the repair process, and show that a remarkable degree of spatial patterning accompanies damage-induced membrane dynamics.', u'issn': u'1059-1524', u'number': u'14', u'month': u'jul', u'volume': u'27', u'link': u'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4945144/', u'pages': u'2272--2285', u'file': u'PubMed Central Full Text PDF:C\\\\:\\\\\\\\Users\\\\\\\\lociuser\\\\\\\\Zotero\\\\\\\\storage\\\\\\\\5W6FUSM3\\\\\\\\Davenport et al. - 2016 - Membrane dynamics during cellular wound repair.pdf:application/pdf', u'year': u'2016', u'urldate': u'2017-11-23', u'pmid': u'27226483', 'ID': 'davenport_membrane_2016', u'journal': u'Molecular Biology of the Cell', u'pmcid': u'PMC4945144'}\n",

This study characterized the effect of NO(*) on mitochondrial membrane changes by exploring the relationship among NO(*), excitatory receptor activation, and the induction of peroxynitrite, a highly toxic NO(*) reactant, to neuronal injury. Cultured rat cortical neurons were exposed to the NO(*) generator, diethylenetriamine/nitric oxide adduct, and were examined for signs of cell death, mitochondrial membrane potential changes (Deltapsi(m)), and the induction of a mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT). Neurons were also examined for nitrotyrosine (NT) immunoreactivity, a marker of reactive nitrogen species (RNS) formation. Neurons exposed to NO(*) or to N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) exhibited similar rapid depolarization of mitochondria, which was prevented by an NMDA receptor antagonist. Electrophysiological studies demonstrated NO(*) potentiation of NMDA-induced NMDA receptor currents. NO(*) and NMDA-treated neurons had evidence of mitochondrial-specific NT immunoreactivity that was prevented by a SOD/catalase mimetic (EUK-134). EUK-134 treatment reduced both NO(*) and NMDA-induced NT formation and neuronal cell death. EUK-134 did not prevent NO-induced Deltapsi(m) but partially prevented NMDA-induced Deltapsi(m) loss. Although NO(*) and NMDA both induced MPT and MPT inhibitors prevented NO-induced Deltapsi(m), they did not result in significant neuroprotection, in contrast to treatment designed to decrease peroxynitrite formation.

The stromal environment consists of many cell types and various extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins that support normal tissue maintenance and which have been implicated in tumor progression. Both the chemical and mechanical properties of the ECM have been shown to influence normal and malignant cell behavior. For instance, mesenchymal stem cells differentiate into specific lineages that are dependent on matrix stiffness, while tumor cells undergo changes in cell behavior and gene expression in response to matrix stiffness. ECM remodeling is implicated in tumor progression and can result in increased deposition of stromal ECM, enhanced contraction of ECM fibrils, and altered collagen alignment and ECM stiffness. Tumor cells respond to changes in ECM remodeling through altered intracellular signaling and cell cycle control that lead to enhanced proliferation, loss of normal tissue architecture, and local tumor cell migration and invasion.

Due to their upright standing orientation, the characteristic extinction resonances of these nanojets are studied by grazing incidence infrared spectroscopy with p-polarized radiation. The resonance wavelength strongly depends on the lateral extent of the nanojet and can be tailored by adjusting the focusing numerical aperture and the applied pulse energy. The observed correlation between the lateral extent of the nanojet and the resonance wavelength is described by the monopole model of a linear antenna.

We found a population of CTxB undergoing purely isotropic diffusion and one displaying restricted diffusion with corral sizes ranging from 150 to \\u223c1800\\xa0nm. We show that the diffusion rate of CTxB bound to GM1 is independent of the size of the confinement, suggesting that the mechanism of confinement is different from the mechanism controlling the diffusion rate of CtxB.

The nanoscale spatial distribution of the molecules inside the detection volume of a scanning microscope can be encoded within the fluorescence dynamics and decoded by resolving the signal into its dynamics components. Here we present a robust and general method to decode this information using phasor analysis. As an example of the application of this method, we optically generate spatially controlled gradients in the fluorescence lifetime by stimulated emission. Spatial resolution can be increased indefinitely by increasing the number of resolved dynamics components up to a maximum determined by the amount of noise. We demonstrate that the proposed method provides nanoscale imaging of subcellular structures, opening new routes in super-resolution microscopy based on the encoding/decoding of spatial information through manipulation of molecular dynamics., Increasing the resolution of fluorescence microscopy is a fundamental need for modern cell biology.

This study aimed to determine the proteolytic degradation of egg white proteins in wheat sourdoughs acidified with lactobacilli differing in their thiol metabolism. Ovotransferrin was the only major egg white protein that degraded during sourdough fermentations. An extensive degradation of ovotransferrin required a heterofermentative lactobacilli starter, Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis, with glutathione reductase activity. Ovotransferrin was more resistant to breakdown when sourdoughs were acidified with homofermentative lactobacilli or a mutant strain of L. sanfranciscensis lacking the glutathione reductase. Its susceptibility to proteolysis in L. sanfranciscensis sourdoughs is thus attributable to thiol accumulation by L. sanfranciscensis, which apparently altered the structure of ovotransferrin through a reduction of disulfide bonds.

These results imply novel roles for R-Ras and TC21 in promoting a transformed phenotype and in the basal migration and polarization of these cells.

This was further supported by experiments in which R-Ras enhanced the migration of cells expressing integrin chimeras containing the alpha2, but not the alpha5, cytoplasmic domain. In addition, a transdominant inhibition previously noted only between integrin beta cytoplasmic domains was observed for the alpha2 cytoplasmic domain; alpha2beta1-mediated migration was inhibited by the expression of excess alpha2 but not alpha5 cytoplasmic domain-containing chimeras, suggesting the existence of limiting factors that bind the integrin alpha subunit. Using pharmacological inhibitors, we found that R-Ras induced migration on collagen through a combination of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and protein kinase C, but not MAPK, which is distinct from the other Ras family members, Rac, Cdc42, and N- and K-Ras. Thus, R-Ras communicates with specific integrin alpha cytoplasmic domains through a unique combination of signaling pathways to promote cell migration and invasion.', u'issn': u'0021-9525', u'number': u'5', u'month': u'may', u'volume': u'145', u'pages': u'1077--1088', u'keyword': u'Cell Movement, Humans, Signal Transduction, Female, Breast, Epithelial Cells, Integrins, ras Proteins, Cell Line, Transformed, GTP Phosphohydrolases', 'ID': 'keely_r-ras_1999', u'year': u'1999', u'pmid': u'10352023', u'journal': u'The Journal of Cell Biology', u'pmcid': u'PMC2133135'}\n",

The sample investigated consisted of 13 children for whom 4 premolar and 19 molar teeth were judged to require a sealant. The indication was based on the criteria 'fissure discoloration', 'enamel decalcification' and 'absence of dentinal decay'. For predefined locations within these occlusal fissures a diagnosis was obtained by the following diagnostic systems: clinical examination, examination on fiber-optic transillumination (FOTI), fissure discoloration, electrical resistance measurement, radiographic examination and ratings of fissure morphology. Tooth material was removed until no (more) carious enamel or dentin was left. Two dentists then jointly decided on the status of decay for each of the defined locations within the fissure. These ratings served as the 'gold standard' diagnoses. The electrical resistance measurement with a sensitivity of 0.96 and a specificity of 0.71 was the only diagnostic tool with acceptable performance. Radiographic diagnosis was characterized by a moderate sensitivity and specificity. All other diagnostic systems had either very low sensitivities or very low specificities, or both. The positive predictive value of FOTI examination and the negative predictive value of the electrical resistance measurements were very high, irrespective of the prevalence of occlusal dentinal decay.\", u'issn': u'0008-6568', u'number': u'1', u'pages': u'59--64', u'volume': u'26', u'keyword': u'Humans, Adolescent, Child, Sensitivity and Specificity, Predictive Value of Tests, Fiber Optic Technology, Optical Fibers, Dental Caries, Dental Fissures, Dentin, Dental Enamel, Transillumination, Dental Models, Electric Conductivity, Radiography, Bitewing', u'year': u'1992', u'pmid': u'1568239', u'journal': u'Caries Research', 'ID': 'verdonschot_performance_1992'}\n",

Thus, correction of mitochondrial dysfunction and induction of apoptosis are promising strategies in cancer treatment. We have used Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM) to quantify mitochondrial metabolic response in PCa cells by tracking auto-fluorescent NAD(P)H, FAD and tryptophan (Trp) lifetimes and their enzyme-bound fractions as markers, before and after treatment with anti-cancer drug doxorubicin.

Changes in the actin cytoskeleton associated with this switch suggest that the small GTPases Cdc42 and Rac, which regulate actin organization, might modulate motility and invasion. However, the role of Cdc42 and Rac1 in epithelial cells, especially with respect to integrin-mediated events, has not been well characterized. Here we show that activation of Cdc42 and Rac1 disrupts the normal polarization of mammary epithelial cells in a collagenous matrix, and promotes motility and invasion. This motility does not require the activation of PAK, JNK, p70 S6 kinase, or Rho, but instead requires phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI(3)K). Further, direct PI(3)K activation is sufficient to disrupt epithelial polarization and induce cell motility and invasion.

Confocal fluorescence microscopy was used to acquire NADH and FAD auto-fluorescent images. The optical redox ratio was highest in cells overexpressing HER2 and lowest in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells, which lack HER2, progesterone receptor, and estrogen receptor (ER). The redox ratio in ER-positive/HER2-negative cells was higher than what was seen in TNBC cells, but lower than that in HER2 overexpressing cells. Importantly, inhibition of HER2 using trastuzumab significantly reduced the redox ratio in HER2 overexpressing cells. Furthermore, the combinatorial inhibition of HER2 and ER decreased the redox ratio in ER+/HER2+ breast cancer cells to a greater extent than inhibition of either receptor alone. Interestingly, trastuzumab had little impact upon the redox ratio in a cell line selected for acquired resistance to trastuzumab. Taken together, these data indicate that the optical redox ratio measures changes in tumor metabolism that reflect the oncogenic effects of HER2 activity within the cell, as well as the response of the cell to therapeutic inhibition of HER2.

We confirm that OMI correlates with cellular glycolytic levels across a panel of human breast cell lines using standard assays of cellular rates of glucose uptake and lactate secretion (P {\\\\textless} 0.05, r = 0.89). In addition, OMI resolves differences in the basal metabolic activity of untransformed from malignant breast cells (P {\\\\textless} 0.05) and between breast cancer subtypes (P {\\\\textless} 0.05), defined by estrogen receptor and/or HER2 expression or absence. In vivo OMI is sensitive to metabolic changes induced by inhibition of HER2 with the antibody trastuzumab (herceptin) in HER2-overexpressing human breast cancer xenografts in mice. This response was confirmed with tumor growth curves and stains for Ki67 and cleaved caspase-3. OMI resolved trastuzumab-induced changes in cellular metabolism in vivo as early as 48 hours posttreatment (P {\\\\textless} 0.05), whereas fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography did not resolve any changes with trastuzumab up to 12 days posttreatment (P {\\\\textgreater} 0.05). In addition, OMI resolved cellular subpopulations of differing response in vivo that are critical for investigating drug resistance mechanisms. Importantly, OMI endpoints remained unchanged with trastuzumab treatment in trastuzumab-resistant xenografts (P {\\\\textgreater} 0.05). OMI has significant implications for rapid cellular-level assessment of metabolic response to molecular expression and drug action, which would greatly accelerate drug development studies.', u'issn': u'1538-7445', u'number': u'20', u'month': u'oct', u'volume': u'73', u'pages': u'6164--6174', u'keyword': u'Animals, Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized, Antineoplastic Agents, Breast Neoplasms, Cell Line, Tumor, Disease Models, Animal, Female, Flavin-Adenine Dinucleotide, Glycolysis, Humans, Mice, Mice, Nude, NAD, Optical Imaging, Receptor, ErbB-2, Trastuzumab, Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'ID': 'walsh_optical_2013', u'year': u'2013', u'pmid': u'24130112', u'journal': u'Cancer Research', u'pmcid': u'PMC3801432'}\n",

The ultra-precise intra-tissue nanoprocessing is achieved by the generation of high light intensity (10(12)W cm(-2)) by diffraction-limited focusing of the radiation of an NIR (lambda = 740 and 800 nm) femtosecond titanium-sapphire laser to a sub-femtolitre volume and subsequent highly localized instantaneous plasma formation.

Further evidence, including two-photon imaging of chlorophyll fluorescence, revealed that a single target chloroplast or part thereof can be completely knocked out using intense ultra-fast NIR pulses without any visible deleterious effect on the adjacent plastids. The vitality of the cells after nanoprocessing has been ascertained by exclusion of propidium iodide from the cells as well as by the presence of cytoplasmic streaming.

Such problems can be overcome by means of molecular three-photon excitation (3PE) with infrared femtosecond light pulses since longer excitation wavelengths result in less Raleigh scattering, and the subfemtoliter (confocal-like) 3PE volume minimizes out-of-focus photobleaching, background generation, and inner filter effects.

Freshly harvested rat medial collateral ligaments (MCLs) were used as a model in ex vivo experiments. Ligaments were preloaded with 0.1 N to establish a consistent point of reference for length (and strain) measurements. Ligament structural damage was characterized by nonrecoverable difference in tissue length after a subfailure stretch. The tissue's mechanical properties (via stress vs. strain curves measured from a preloaded state) after a single subfailure stretch were also evaluated (n = 6 pairs with a different stretch magnitude applied to each stretched ligament). Regions containing necrotic cells were used to characterize cellular damage after a single stretch. It should be noted that the number of damaged cells was not quantified and the difference between cellular area and area of fluorescence is not known. Structural and cellular damage were represented and compared as functions of subfailure MCL strains. Statistical analysis indicated that the onset of structural damage occurs at 5.14\\\\% strain (referenced from a preloaded length). Subfailure strains above the damage threshold changed the shape of the MCL stress-strain curve by elongating the toe region (i.e., increasing laxity) as well as decreasing the tangential modulus and ultimate stress. Cellular damage was induced at ligament strains significantly below the structural damage threshold. This cellular damage is likely to be part of the natural healing process in mildly sprained ligaments.\", u'issn': u'8750-7587', u'number': u'1', u'month': u'jan', u'volume': u'92', u'pages': u'362--371', u'keyword': u'Animals, Algorithms, Microscopy, Confocal, Ligaments, Male, Rats, Rats, Sprague-Dawley, Microscopy, Electron, Fibroblasts, Sprains and Strains', u'author': u'Provenzano, Paolo P. and Heisey, Dennis and Hayashi, Kei and Lakes, Roderic and Vanderby, Ray', u'year': u'2002', u'pmid': u'11744679', u'journal': u'Journal of Applied Physiology (Bethesda, Md.: 1985)', 'ID': 'provenzano_subfailure_2002'}\n",

In the parasitic wasp Lariophagus distinguendus, male courtship behaviour consisting of wing fanning, antennal stroking of the female antenna, and head nodding stimulates female receptivity leading to copulation. Recently L. distinguendus was reported to consist of two different lineages, which are sexually isolated because males fail to elicit receptivity in foreign females. It is unclear, however, which part of the courtship behaviour triggers female receptivity and therefore could be a mechanism causing sexual isolation. Here we show that in L. distinguendus a nonvolatile male oral pheromone is essential to release the female receptivity signal. In contrast, male wing fanning and antennal contact play a minor role. Additionally, the composition of the oral pheromone depends on the developmental host and females learn the composition upon emergence from the host substrate.

We correlate these results with measurements of tissue oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin concentration during oxygen deprivation using spatial frequency domain imaging. During arterial occlusion, a decrease in oxyhemoglobin corresponds to an increase in NADH fluorescence in the basal epidermal cells, implying a reduction in basal cell oxidative phosphorylation. The ischemia-induced oxygen deprivation is associated with a strong increase in NADH fluorescence of keratinocytes in layers close to the stratum basale, whereas keratinocytes from epidermal layers closer to the skin surface are not affected. Spatial frequency domain imaging optical property measurements, combined with a multilayer Monte Carlo-based radiative transport model of multiphoton microscopy signal collection in skin, establish that localized tissue optical property changes during occlusion do not impact the observed NADH signal increase.

As an early marker of drug response in cells, cellular metabolism provides an attractive platform for high-throughput drug testing. Optical techniques can noninvasively monitor NADH and FAD, two autofluorescent metabolic coenzymes. The autofluorescent redox ratio, defined as the autofluorescence intensity of NADH divided by that of FAD, quantifies relative rates of cellular glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. However, current microscopy methods for redox ratio quantification are time-intensive and low-throughput, limiting their practicality in drug screening.

Melanosomes are transported by microtubule motors, kinesin-2 and cytoplasmic dynein, and an actin motor, myosin-V. We explored the regulation of melanosome transport along microtubules in vivo by using a new fast-tracking routine, which determines the melanosome position every 10 ms with 2-nm precision. The velocity distribution of melanosomes transported by cytoplasmic dynein or kinesin-2 under conditions of aggregation and dispersion presented several peaks and could not be fit with a single Gaussian function. We postulated that the melanosome velocity depends linearly on the number of active motors. According to this model, one to three dynein molecules transport each melanosome in the minus-end direction. The transport in the plus-end direction is mainly driven by one to two copies of kinesin-2. The number of dyneins transporting a melanosome increases during aggregation, whereas the number of active kinesin-2 stays the same during aggregation and dispersion. Thus, the number of active dynein molecules regulates the net direction of melanosome transport. The model also shows that multiple motors of the same polarity cooperate during the melanosome transport, whereas motors of opposite polarity do not compete.', u'issn': u'0006-3495', u'number': u'1', u'month': u'jan', u'volume': u'90', u'link': u'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1367030/', u'pages': u'318--327', u'file': u'PubMed Central Full Text PDF:C\\\\:\\\\\\\\Users\\\\\\\\lociuser\\\\\\\\Zotero\\\\\\\\storage\\\\\\\\94DAUT4Q\\\\\\\\Levi et al. - 2006 - Organelle Transport along Microtubules in Xenopus .pdf:application/pdf', u'year': u'2006', u'urldate': u'2017-11-23', u'pmid': u'16214870', 'ID': 'levi_organelle_2006', u'journal': u'Biophysical Journal', u'pmcid': u'PMC1367030'}\n",

Recent studies suggest that this counterregulation results, at least in part, from regulation of the expression of both the antihypertensive dopamine 5 receptor (D5R) and the prohypertensive Ang II type 1 receptor (AT1R). In this report, we investigated the in vivo and in vitro interaction between these GPCRs. Disruption of the gene encoding D5R in mice increased both blood pressure and AT1R protein expression, and the increase in blood pressure was reversed by AT1R blockade. Activation of D5R increased the degradation of glycosylated AT1R in proteasomes in HEK cells and human renal proximal tubule cells heterologously and endogenously expressing human AT1R and D5R. Confocal microscopy, F\\xf6rster/fluorescence resonance energy transfer microscopy, and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy revealed that activation of D5R initiated ubiquitination of the glycosylated AT1R at the plasma membrane. The regulated degradation of AT1R via a ubiquitin/proteasome pathway by activation of D5R provides what we believe to be a novel mechanism whereby blood pressure can be regulated by the interaction of 2 counterregulatory GPCRs. Our results therefore suggest that treatments for hypertension might be optimized by designing compounds that can target the AT1R and the D5R.', u'issn': u'0021-9738', u'number': u'6', u'month': u'jun', u'volume': u'118', u'pages': u'2180--2189', u'keyword': u'Humans, Animals, Mice, Models, Biological, Cell Line, Cell Membrane, Gene Expression Regulation, Blood Pressure, Glycosylation, Kidney Tubules, Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex, Receptors, Angiotensin, Receptors, Dopamine D5, Ubiquitin', 'ID': 'li_dopamine_2008', u'year': u'2008', u'pmid': u'18464932', u'journal': u'The Journal of Clinical Investigation', u'pmcid': u'PMC2373421'}\n",

These granules have a unique lifetime signature and could be formed by the interaction of reactive oxygen species and unsaturated metabolic precursor that are known to be abundant in hESC. Changes in the relative concentrations of these two intrinsic biomarkers allow for the discrimination of undifferentiated hESCs from differentiating hESCs. During early hESC differentiation we show that NADH concentrations increase, while the concentration of LDAGs decrease. These results are in agreement with a decrease in oxidative phosphorylation rate. Single-cell phasor FLIM signatures reveal an increased heterogeneity in the metabolic states of differentiating H9 and H1 hESC colonies.

The original study design aimed to determine minimal infectious doses after oral or intracerebral (i.c.) infection of macaques to assess the risk for humans. High-dose exposures resulted in 100\\\\% attack rates and a median incubation time of 4.7 years as described previously.

Our findings indicate that a labile heme pool (\\u223c1.6 \\xb5M) is stably maintained throughout parasite development within red blood cells, even during a period coincident with extensive hemoglobin degradation by the parasite. We also find that the heme-binding antimalarial drug chloroquine specifically increases labile cytosolic heme, indicative of dysregulation of this homeostatic pool that may be a relevant component of the antimalarial activity of this compound class. We propose that use of this technology under various environmental perturbations in P. falciparum can yield quantitative insights into fundamental heme biology.', u'issn': u'1091-6490', u'number': u'11', u'month': u'mar', u'volume': u'114', u'pages': u'E2068--E2076', u'keyword': u'genetically encoded biosensor, heme, heme sensor, malaria, Plasmodium falciparum', 'ID': 'abshire_quantification_2017', u'year': u'2017', u'pmid': u'28242687', u'journal': u'Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America', u'pmcid': u'PMC5358388'}\n",

At all three examinations lower socioeconomic (SES) children had a significantly higher caries experience than children the same age in middle and high SES classes. The D2MF-S counts did not change between age 8 and 10, but increased steeply between 10 and 12 yr of age. The D3MF-S counts, on the other hand, rose steadily in all SES classes. The phenomenon was caused by the progression of enamel lesions to dentinal lesions or fillings, leading to a concomitant decrease in the curves of incipient caries lesions (D2). The rise from age 10 to 12 is attributable to new developing enamel lesions. With regard to predilection sites, at all ages and in every SES class, the highest proportion of both indices was due to lesions in occlusal surfaces, followed by buccal and lingual pits and fissures.

Emphasis was placed on creating methods that can compete with PDMS fabrication methods in terms of robustness, complexity, and time requirements. To achieve this goal, several improvements were made to remove critical bottlenecks in existing PS embossing methods. First, traditional lithographic techniques were adapted to fabricate bulk epoxy molds capable of resisting high temperatures and pressures. Second, a method was developed to emboss through-holes in a PS layer, enabling creation of large arrays of independent microfluidic systems on a single device without need to manually create access ports.

To determine more directly the role of the alpha 2 beta 1 integrin, a collagen and laminin receptor, in mediating the collagen-dependent differentiation of mammary cells, we reduced expression of the integrin by the well differentiated human breast carcinoma cell line, T47D, by stably expressing alpha 2 integrin antisense mRNA. Flow cytometry demonstrated that the antisense-expressing clones had levels of alpha 2 beta 1 integrin on their surfaces that were decreased by 30-70\\\\%. Adhesion of antisense-expressing clones to both collagens I and IV was decreased relative to controls in a manner that correlated with the level of cell surface alpha 2 beta 1 integrin expression. Adhesion to fibronectin and laminin were not affected. Motility across collagen-coated filters in haptotaxis assays was increased for only those clones that exhibited intermediate levels of adhesion to collagen, suggesting that an intermediate density of cell-surface alpha 2 beta 1 integrin optimally supports cell motility. When cultured in three-dimensional collagen gels, T47D cells organized in a manner suggestive of a glandular epithelium. In contrast, antisense-expressing clones with decreased alpha 2 beta 1 integrin were not able to organize in three-dimensional collagen gels. The growth rate of T47D cells was reduced when the cells were cultured in three-dimensional collagen gels. Unlike adhesion, motility, and morphogenesis, growth rates were unaffected by reduction of alpha 2 beta 1 integrin expression.

Our previous studies using 670 nm light-emitting diode (LED) arrays suggest that cytochrome c oxidase, a photoacceptor in the NIR range, plays an important role in therapeutic photobiomodulation. If this is true, then an irreversible inhibitor of cytochrome c oxidase, potassium cyanide (KCN), should compete with LED and reduce its beneficial effects. This hypothesis was tested on primary cultured neurons. LED treatment partially restored enzyme activity blocked by 10-100 microm KCN. It significantly reduced neuronal cell death induced by 300 microm KCN from 83.6 to 43.5\\\\%. However, at 1-100 mm KCN, the protective effects of LED decreased, and neuronal deaths increased. LED significantly restored neuronal ATP content only at 10 microm KCN but not at higher concentrations of KCN tested. Pretreatment with LED enhanced efficacy of LED during exposure to 10 or 100 microm KCN but did not restore enzyme activity to control levels. In contrast, LED was able to completely reverse the detrimental effect of tetrodotoxin, which only indirectly down-regulated enzyme levels. Among the wavelengths tested (670, 728, 770, 830, and 880 nm), the most effective ones (830 nm, 670 nm) paralleled the NIR absorption spectrum of oxidized cytochrome c oxidase, whereas the least effective wavelength, 728 nm, did not.

Here, we use a conditional/invertible genetic strategy to identify the cell lineage(s) responsible for the development of heart defects in a Nipbl-deficient mouse model of Cornelia de Lange Syndrome, in which global yet subtle transcriptional dysregulation leads to development of atrial septal defects (ASDs) at high frequency. Using an approach that allows for recombinase-mediated creation or rescue of Nipbl deficiency in different lineages, we uncover complex interactions between the cardiac mesoderm, endoderm, and the rest of the embryo, whereby the risk conferred by genetic abnormality in any one lineage is modified, in a surprisingly non-additive way, by the status of others. We argue that these results are best understood in the context of a model in which the risk of heart defects is associated with the adequacy of early progenitor cell populations relative to the sizes of the structures they must eventually form., Congenital heart defects, the most common birth defect, are thought mainly to arise through interactions among multiple genes. We studied atrial septal defects (a common type of heart defect) in a mouse model of Cornelia de Lange Syndrome, in which loss of one copy of the Nipbl gene produces frequent developmental abnormalities. By causing subtle dysregulation of the expression of many hundreds of genes, Nipbl haploinsufficiency serves as a model for the polygenic origins of common birth defects. We used an improved genetic technology to separately create or rescue deficiency for Nipbl within the major cardiogenic tissue lineages (lineages that contribute to or control the morphogenesis of the developing heart). Unexpectedly, we found that risk for developing atrial septal defects could not be mapped to any single one of these cardiogenic lineages, but rather was determined by non-additive interactions between these lineages and the rest of the body. Intriguingly, being Nipbl-deficient in the rest of the body reduced the risk conferred by being Nipbl-deficient in either of two distinct cardiogenic lineages. We hypothesize that this effect is driven by developmental coupling between body size and heart size, with defects arising when progenitor cells cannot be provided fast enough to meet the requirements imposed on the heart by other growing tissues. To our knowledge, this is the first genetic demonstration that major risk factors for heart defects are likely to lie outside of the heart itself.', u'issn': u'1544-9173', u'number': u'9', u'month': u'sep', u'volume': u'14', u'link': u'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5016002/', u'file': u'PubMed Central Full Text PDF:C\\\\:\\\\\\\\Users\\\\\\\\lociuser\\\\\\\\Zotero\\\\\\\\storage\\\\\\\\UEJ437YX\\\\\\\\Santos et al. - 2016 - Conditional Creation and Rescue of Nipbl-Deficienc.pdf:application/pdf', u'year': u'2016', u'urldate': u'2017-11-23', u'pmid': u'27606604', 'ID': 'santos_conditional_2016', u'journal': u'PLoS Biology', u'pmcid': u'PMC5016002'}\n",

Western blots verified that VGSC\\u03b1 proteins were expressed in HUVECs, and immunohistochemistry revealed VGSC\\u03b1 expression in mouse aortic ECs in vivo. Electrophysiological recordings showed that the channels were functional and suppressed by tetrodotoxin (TTX). VGSC activity modulated the following angiogenic properties of HUVECs: VEGF-induced proliferation or chemotaxis, tubular differentiation, and substrate adhesion. Interestingly, different aspects of angiogenesis were controlled by the different VGSC isoforms based on TTX sensitivity and effects of siRNA-mediated gene silencing. Additionally, we show for the first time that TTX-resistant (TTX-R) VGSCs (Nav1.5) potentiate VEGF-induced ERK1/2 activation through the PKC\\u03b1-B-RAF signaling axis. We postulate that this potentiation occurs through modulation of VEGF-induced HUVEC depolarization and [Ca2+]i.

In this review, each of these developments is described, and their significance for wound healing research is considered. In addition, overlapping mechanisms of single-cell and multicellular wound healing are highlighted, and it is argued that they are more similar than is often recognized.

Recently, we have reported that lipopolysaccharides inhibit in vitro microtubule formation due to exclusion of microtubule-associated proteins. The distinct epitopes of lipopolysaccharides responsible for these effects and the in vivo relevance of these data are unknown. Therefore, this study was conducted to elucidate the effects of lipid A, the biologically active motif of lipopolysaccharides, on microtubule formation in vitro and to prove whether lipopolysaccharides affect the microtubule architecture of cultured human monocytes in vivo. Despite a dose- and pH-dependent inhibition of microtubule formation by lipopolysaccharides, inhibition of microtubule assembly could be mimicked by lipid A. Near-infrared two-photon microscopy revealed that human peripheral blood monocytes accumulate lipopolysaccharides. A vesicular distribution pattern of lipopolysaccharides within the monocytes was observed. Confocal laser scanning microscopy demonstrated alterations in the microtubule architecture of monocytes after incubation with lipopolysaccharides. Lipid A seems to be responsible for the observed crosstalk between lipopolysaccharides and microtubule proteins. Furthermore, our data indicate that lipopoly-saccharides may affect the microtubule architecture in human monocytes after intracellular accumulation directly.

Prior to exocytosis, myosin1e relocates to the surface of cortical granules. Overexpression of myosin1e augments the kinetics of cortical granule exocytosis, whereas tail-derived fragments of myosin1e inhibit this secretory event (but not constitutive exocytosis). Finally, intracellular injection of myosin1e antibody inhibits cortical granule exocytosis. Further experiments identified cysteine string proteins as interacting partners for myosin1e.

We tested the hypotheses that systemic administration of IGF-I, or growth hormone (GH), or both (GH+IGF-I) would improve healing in collagenous connective tissue, such as ligament. These hypotheses were examined in rats that were allowed unrestricted activity after injury and in animals that were subjected to hindlimb disuse. Male rats were assigned to three groups: ambulatory sham-control, ambulatory-healing, and hindlimb unloaded-healing. Ambulatory and hindlimb unloaded animals underwent surgical disruption of their knee medial collateral ligaments (MCLs), while sham surgeries were performed on control animals. Healing animals subcutaneously received systemic doses of either saline, GH, IGF-I, or GH+IGF-I. After 3 weeks, mechanical properties, cell and matrix morphology, and biochemical composition were examined in control and healing ligaments.\\nRESULTS: Tissues from ambulatory animals receiving only saline had significantly greater strength than tissue from saline receiving hindlimb unloaded animals. Addition of IGF-I significantly improved maximum force and ultimate stress in tissues from both ambulatory and hindlimb unloaded animals with significant increases in matrix organization and type-I collagen expression. Addition of GH alone did not have a significant effect on either group, while addition of GH+IGF-I significantly improved force, stress, and modulus values in MCLs from hindlimb unloaded animals. Force, stress, and modulus values in tissues from hindlimb unloaded animals receiving IGF-I or GH+IGF-I exceeded (or were equivalent to) values in tissues from ambulatory animals receiving only saline with greatly improved structural organization and significantly increased type-I collagen expression. Furthermore, levels of IGF-receptor were significantly increased in tissues from hindlimb unloaded animals treated with IGF-I.\\nCONCLUSION: These results support two of our hypotheses that systemic administration of IGF-I or GH+IGF-I improve healing in collagenous tissue. Systemic administration of IGF-I improves healing in collagenous extracellular matrices from loaded and unloaded tissues.

Our results demonstrate that mKO2 and mTFP are good FRET partners given proper imaging setups. mTFP was optimally excited by the Argon 458 laser line, and the 540-nm wavelength excitation for mKO2 was chosen from the white-light laser. The white-light laser generally extends the usage of orange and red/far-red FPs in sensitized FRET microscopy assays by tailoring excitation and emission precisely to the needs of the FRET pair.', u'issn': u'1560-2281', u'number': u'5', u'month': u'oct', u'volume': u'14', u'pages': u'054009', u'keyword': u'Animals, Mice, Equipment Design, Microscopy, Fluorescence, Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer, Cell Line, Luminescent Proteins, Reproducibility of Results, Sensitivity and Specificity, Equipment Failure Analysis, Lasers, Pituitary Gland', 'ID': 'sun_characterization_2009', u'year': u'2009', u'pmid': u'19895111', u'journal': u'Journal of Biomedical Optics', u'pmcid': u'PMC2774974'}\n",

We use this method to demonstrate a dependence of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) mobility on oligomeric state. We find that on entering the nucleus STAT3 dimers must first bind DNA to form STAT3 tetramers, which are also DNA-bound but exhibit a different mobility signature. Examining the dimer-to-tetramer transition by a cross-pair correlation analysis (cpCOMB) reveals that chromatin accessibility modulates STAT3 tetramer formation.

The models of shear stress used to analyze the effects of loading bone cells in vitro include both oscillatory and unidirectional fluid shear profiles. Although the fluid flow profile experienced by cells within bone is most likely oscillatory in nature, to date there have been few direct comparisons of how bone cells respond to these two fluid flow profiles. In this study we evaluated morphologic and biochemical responses to a time course of unidirectional and oscillatory fluid flow in two commonly used bone cell lines, MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts and MLO-Y4 osteocytes. We determined that stress fibers formed and aligned within osteoblasts after 1 h of unidirectional fluid flow, but this response was not observed until greater than 5 h of oscillatory fluid flow. Despite the delay in stress fiber formation, oscillatory and unidirectional fluid flow profiles elicited similar temporal effects on the induction of both cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) and osteopontin protein expression in osteoblasts. Interestingly, MLO-Y4 osteocytes formed organized stress fibers after exposure to 24 h of unidirectional shear stress, while the number of dendritic processes per cell increased along with Cox-2 protein levels after 24 h of oscillatory shear stress. Despite these differences, both flow profiles significantly altered osteopontin levels in MLO-Y4 osteocytes.

There are two predominant renal sodium phosphate cotransporters, NaPi2a and NaPi2c. Both are regulated by parathyroid hormone (PTH), which decreases the abundance of the NaPi cotransporters in the apical membrane of renal proximal tubule cells. The time course of PTH-induced removal of the two cotransporters from the apical membrane, however, is markedly different for NaPi2a compared with NaPi2c. In animals and in cell culture, PTH treatment results in almost complete removal of NaPi2a from the brush border (BB) within 1 h whereas for NaPi2c this process in not complete until 4 to 8 h after PTH treatment. The reason for this is poorly understood. We have previously shown that the unconventional myosin motor myosin VI is required for PTH-induced removal of NaPi2a from the proximal tubule BB. Here we demonstrate that myosin VI is also necessary for PTH-induced removal of NaPi2c from the apical membrane. In addition, we show that, while at baseline the two cotransporters have similar diffusion coefficients within the membrane, after PTH addition the diffusion coefficient for NaPi2a initially exceeds that for NaPi2c.

In amniote embryos, this process occurs via an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) of epiblast cells at the primitive streak. Although the primitive streak is vital to development, many aspects of how it forms and functions remain poorly understood.\\nRESULTS: Using live, 4 dimensional imaging and immunohistochemistry, we have shown that the posterior epiblast of the pre-streak murine embryo does not display convergence and extension behavior or large scale migration or rearrangement of a cell population. Instead, the primitive streak develops in situ and elongates by progressive initiation EMT in the posterior epiblast. Loss of basal lamina (BL) is the first step of this EMT, and is strictly correlated with ingression of nascent mesoderm. Once the BL is lost in a given region, cells leave the epiblast by apical constriction in order to enter the primitive streak.\\nCONCLUSIONS: This is the first description of dynamic cell behavior during primitive streak formation in the mouse embryo, and reveals mechanisms that are quite distinct from those observed in other amniote model systems. Unlike chick and rabbit, the murine primitive streak arises in situ by progressive initiation of EMT beginning in the posterior epiblast, without large-scale movement or convergence and extension of epiblast cells.', u'issn': u'1097-0177', u'number': u'2', u'month': u'feb', u'volume': u'241', u'pages': u'270--283', u'keyword': u'Cell Movement, Animals, Mice, Signal Transduction, Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition, Germ Layers, Mice, Inbred Strains, Primitive Streak', 'ID': 'williams_mouse_2012', u'year': u'2012', u'pmid': u'22170865', u'journal': u'Developmental Dynamics: An Official Publication of the American Association of Anatomists', u'pmcid': u'PMC3266444'}\n",

Problems hindering the design of improved oxygen sensors include non-linear Stern-Volmer calibration plots and the multi-exponentiality of measured lifetime decays, both of which are attributed primarily to heterogeneity of the sensor molecule in the polymer support matrix. Conventional, confocal and two-photon fluorescence microscopy have proven to be invaluable tools with which the microscale heterogeneity and response of luminescence-based oxygen sensors can be investigated and compared to the macroscopic response. Results obtained for three ruthenium(II) alpha-diimine complexes in polydimethylsiloxane polymer supports indicate the presence of unquenched microcrystals within the polymer matrix that probably degrade oxygen quenching sensitivity and linearity of the Stern-Volmer quenching plot.

The functional need for several transporters accomplishing the same role is still not clear. However, the fact that these transporters show differential regulation under dietary and hormonal stimuli suggests different roles in Pi reabsorption. The pathways controlling this differential regulation are still unknown, but one of the candidates involved is the NHERF family of scaffolding PDZ proteins. We propose that differences in the molecular interaction with PDZ proteins are related with the differential adaptation of Na/Pi transporters.

We studied the specific protein-protein interactions of Na/Pi transporters with NHERF-1 and PDZK1 by FRET. FRET measurements showed a much stronger interaction of NHERF-1 with NaPi-2a than with NaPi-2c. However, both Na/Pi transporters showed similar FRET efficiencies with PDZK1. Interestingly, in cells adapted to low Pi concentrations, there were increases in NaPi-2c/PDZK1 and NaPi-2a/NHERF-1 interactions. The differential affinity of the Na/Pi transporters for NHERF-1 and PDZK1 proteins could partially explain their differential regulation and/or stability in the apical membrane.

A low GP value corresponds to a higher fluidity and a higher GP value is associated with a more rigid membrane. Four different cell lines were monitored such as hN2, NIH3T3, HEK293 and L6 cells. Membrane fluidity was measured at 12h, 72h and 92 h. Our results show significant changes in membrane fluidity among all cell types at different time points.

Cortactin is a Src substrate that drives actin polymerization by activating the Arp2/3 complex and also stabilizes the cortical actin network. We now provide evidence that proteolysis of cortactin by calpain 2 regulates membrane protrusion dynamics during cell migration. We show that cortactin is a calpain 2 substrate in fibroblasts and that the preferred cleavage site occurs in a region between the actin binding repeats and the alpha-helical domain.

Expression of the calpain-resistant cortactin, but not wild-type cortactin, impairs cell migration and increases transient membrane protrusion, suggesting that calpain proteolysis of cortactin limits membrane protrusions and regulates migration in fibroblasts. Furthermore, the enhanced protrusion observed with the calpain-resistant cortactin requires both the Arp2/3 binding site and the Src homology 3 domain of cortactin.

This phenotype is described as \\u201cmethionine dependence\\u201d or \\u201cmethionine stress sensitivity\\u201d in which cancer cells are unable to proliferate when methionine has been replaced with its metabolic precursor, homocysteine, in cell culture growth media. We focus on the metabolic response to methionine stress in the triple negative breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-468 and its methionine insensitive derivative cell line MDA-MB-468res-R8.\\n\\nResults\\nUsing a variety of techniques including fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) and extracellular flux assays, we identified a metabolic down-regulation of oxidative phosphorylation in both MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-468res-R8 cell types when cultured in homocysteine media. Untargeted metabolomics was performed by way of gas chromatography/time-of-flight mass spectrometry on both cell types cultured in homocysteine media over a period of 2 to 24\\xa0h. We determined unique metabolic responses between the two cell lines in specific pathways including methionine salvage, purine/pyrimidine synthesis, and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Stable isotope tracer studies using deuterium-labeled homocysteine indicated a redirection of homocysteine metabolism toward the transsulfuration pathway and glutathione synthesis. This data corroborates with increased glutathione levels concomitant with increased levels of oxidized glutathione. Redirection of homocysteine flux resulted in reduced generation of methionine from homocysteine particularly in MDA-MB-468 cells. Consequently, synthesis of the important one-carbon donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) was decreased, perturbing the SAM to S-adenosylhomocysteine ratio in MDA-MB-468 cells, which is an indicator of the cellular methylation potential.\\n\\nConclusion\\nThis study indicates a differential metabolic response between the methionine sensitive MDA-MB-468 cells and the methionine insensitive derivative cell line MDA-MB-468res-R8. Both cell lines appear to experience oxidative stress when methionine was replaced with its metabolic precursor homocysteine, forcing cells to redirect homocysteine metabolism toward the transsulfuration pathway to increase glutathione synthesis. The methionine stress resistant MDA-MB-468res-R8 cells responded to this cellular stress earlier than the methionine stress sensitive MDA-MB468 cells and coped better with metabolic demands. Additionally, it is evident that S-adenosylmethionine metabolism is dependent on methionine availability in cancer cells, which cannot be sufficiently supplied by homocysteine metabolism under these conditions.', u'issn': u'2049-3002', u'month': u'may', u'volume': u'4', u'link': u'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4852440/', u'file': u'PubMed Central Full Text PDF:C\\\\:\\\\\\\\Users\\\\\\\\lociuser\\\\\\\\Zotero\\\\\\\\storage\\\\\\\\37APVFSJ\\\\\\\\Borrego et al. - 2016 - Metabolic changes associated with methionine stres.pdf:application/pdf', u'year': u'2016', u'urldate': u'2017-11-22', u'pmid': u'27141305', 'ID': 'borrego_metabolic_2016', u'journal': u'Cancer \\\\& Metabolism', u'pmcid': u'PMC4852440'}\n",

One randomly selected LCL was stretched in situ using a custom designed device in eighteen young (21 days) and eighteen skeletally mature (8 months) male rats. Animals were euthanized at 0, 7, and 14 days post-surgery, and ligament ultimate stress, strain at failure and laxity were determined (n = 6 pairs per group).

The mature rats had 54 +/- 9\\\\% strength of the control while the immature rats had 58 +/- 11\\\\% of the strength of the control, representing a consistent and significant injury. The immature and mature ligaments showed similar patterns of cellular damage post-injury and had similar modes of mechanical failure.

However, ligament laxity was still present in both groups two weeks after the injury and was not completely removed by growth in the immature group.

The biochemical suicide molecule endonuclease DNaseX (DNaseI-like 1) has been used to identify the Apo10 protein epitope that marks tumor cells with abnormal apoptosis and proliferation. The transketolase-like protein 1 (TKTL1) represents the enzymatic basis for an anaerobic glucose metabolism even in the presence of oxygen (aerobic glycolysis/Warburg effect), which is concomitant with a more malignant phenotype due to invasive growth/metastasis and resistance to radical and apoptosis inducing therapies.\\nMETHODS: Expression of Apo10 and TKTL1 was analysed retrospectively in OSCC specimen (n\\u2009=\\u2009161) by immunohistochemistry. Both markers represent independent markers for poor survival. Furthermore Apo10 and TKTL1 have been used prospectively for epitope detection in monocytes (EDIM)-blood test in patients with OSCC (n\\u2009=\\u200950), breast cancer (n\\u2009=\\u200948), prostate cancer (n\\u2009=\\u2009115), and blood donors/controls (n\\u2009=\\u200974).\\nRESULTS: Positive Apo10 and TKTL1 expression were associated with recurrence of the tumor. Multivariate analysis demonstrated Apo10 and TKTL1 expression as an independent prognostic factor for reduced tumor-specific survival. Apo10+/TKTL1+ subgroup showed the worst disease-free survival rate in OSCC.EDIM-Apo10 and EDIM-TKTL1 blood tests allowed a sensitive and specific detection of patients with OSCC, breast cancer and prostate cancer before surgery and in after care.

Consistent with this ability, active Rho and Cdc42 occupy mutually exclusive zones during single cell wound repair and asymmetric cytokinesis, suggesting the existence of mechanisms for local crosstalk, but how local Rho GTPase crosstalk is controlled is unknown.\\n\\nResults\\nUsing a candidate screen approach for Rho GTPase activators (Guanine nucleotide exchange factors; GEFs) and Rho GTPase inactivators (GTPase activating proteins; GAPs), we find that Abr, a protein with both GEF and GAP activity, regulates Rho and Cdc42 during single cell wound repair. Abr is targeted to the Rho activity zone via active Rho. Within the Rho zone Abr promotes local Rho activation via its GEF domain and controls local crosstalk via its GAP domain, which limits Cdc42 activity within the Rho zone. Depletion of Abr attenuates Rho activity and wound repair.\\n\\nConclusions\\nAbr is the first identified Rho GTPase regulator of single cell wound healing. Its novel mode of targeting by interaction with active Rho allows Abr to rapidly amplify local increases in Rho activity using its GEF domain while its ability to inactivate Cdc42 using its GAP domain results in sharp segregation of the Rho and Cdc42 zones.

Furthermore, we show that protrusion kinetics of lamellipodia at the leading edge are improperly regulated in Capn4(-/-) cells, leading to impaired net forward lamellipodial extension.

Lateral resolution improvement of up to a factor of 2 has been achieved using structured illumination. In a total internal reflection fluorescence microscope, an evanescence excitation field is formed as light is total internally reflected at an interface between a high and a low index medium. The {\\\\textless}100 nm penetration depth of evanescence field ensures a thin excitation region resulting in low background fluorescence. We present even higher resolution wide-field biological imaging by use of standing wave total internal reflection fluorescence (SW-TIRF). Evanescent standing wave (SW) illumination is used to generate a sinusoidal high spatial frequency fringe pattern on specimen for lateral resolution enhancement. To prevent thermal drift of the SW, novel detection and estimation of the SW phase with real-time feedback control is devised for the stabilization and control of the fringe phase. SW-TIRF is a wide-field superresolution technique with resolution better than a fifth of emission wavelength or approximately 100 nm lateral resolution. We demonstrate the performance of the SW-TIRF microscopy using one- and two-directional SW illumination with a biological sample of cellular actin cytoskeleton of mouse fibroblast cells as well as single semiconductor nanocrystal molecules.

RhoA and Cdc42 are rapidly activated around wound sites in a calcium-dependent manner and segregate into distinct, concentric zones around the wound, with active Cdc42 in the approximate middle of the F-actin array and active RhoA on the interior of the array. These zones form before F-actin accumulation, and then move in concert with the closing array.

By using dual fluorescent ligands simultaneously applied to live cells monotransfected with SSTR5 (R5) or SSTR1 (R1), or cotransfected with R5 and R1, we have analyzed the ligand receptor stoichiometry and aggregation states for the three receptor systems by fluorescence resonance energy transfer and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. Both homo- and heterooligomeric receptors are occupied by two ligand molecules. We find that monomeric, homooligomeric, and heterooligomeric receptor species occur in the same cell cotransfected with two SSTRs, and that oligomerization of SSTRs is regulated by ligand binding by a selective process that is restricted to some (R5) but not other (R1) SSTR subtypes.

We report a novel method for bacterial inactivation based on the optical excitation of the naturally occurring (endogenous) photosensitzing porphyrins by red light. In particular, the pathogenic Gram-positive porphyrin producing ATCC strains Propionibacterium acnes, Actinomyces odontolyticus and Porphyromonas gingivalis were investigated. Sensitive autofluorescence spectroscopy revealed that these bacteria naturally synthezise the fluorescent photosensitizer protoporphyrin IX. In addition, bacterial plaque samples of periodontitis patients were studied. Non-labeled fluorescent bacterial colonies were exposed to red light at 632.8 nm, 100 mW/cm2 light intensity and 360 J/cm2 energy density using a helium-neon laser. The survival rate after a single phototreatment with red light was found to be 0.58 +/- 0.09 in the case of Propionibacterium acnes, 0.30 +/- 0.04 in Actinomyces odontolyticus and 0.59 +/- 0.10 in Porphyrormonas gingivalis compared to non-exposed bacteria suspensions.

Red-light exposed plaque samples of patients showed significant reduction of colony forming units by 50\\\\% as well as a pronounced photoeffect on the pigmented species Prevotella intermedia.

In addition to the sectioning effect generated by the point-like excitation volume, the near-infrared wavelengths used for multi-photon excitation allow deeper penetration into optically turbid specimens. In physiological specimens, the optical properties such as the scattering coefficients and refractive indices are often heterogeneous. In these specimens, it is not clear which type of immersion objective can provide optimized images in-depth. In particular, in-depth dermatological imaging applications using MPFM requires such optimization to obtain qualitative and quantitative information from the skin specimens. In this work, we address this issue by comparing the performances of two common types of high numerical aperture (NA) objectives: water-immersion and oil-immersion. A high-quality water-immersion objective (Zeiss, 40 x C-Apochromat, NA 1.2) and a comparable oil-immersion objective (Zeiss, 40 x Fluar, NA 1.25) were used for in-depth imaging of autofuorescent excised human skin and sulforhodamine B treated human skin specimens. Our results show that in the epidermal layers, the two types of immersion objectives perform comparably. However, in the dermis, multi-photon imaging using the oil immersion objective results in stronger fluorescence detection.

Whereas current angiography methods enable visualization of some retinal capillary detail, they do not adequately reveal the choriocapillaris or other microvascular features beneath the retina. We have developed a noninvasive microvascular imaging technique called phase-variance optical coherence tomography (pvOCT), which identifies vasculature three dimensionally through analysis of data acquired with OCT systems. The pvOCT imaging method is not only capable of generating capillary perfusion maps for the retina, but it can also use the 3D capabilities to segment the data in depth to isolate vasculature in different layers of the retina and choroid. This paper demonstrates some of the capabilities of pvOCT imaging of the anterior layers of choroidal vasculature of a healthy normal eye as well as of eyes with geographic atrophy (GA) secondary to age-related macular degeneration. The pvOCT data presented permit digital segmentation to produce 2D depth-resolved images of the retinal vasculature, the choriocapillaris, and the vessels in Sattler\\u2019s and Haller\\u2019s layers. Comparisons are presented between en face projections of pvOCT data within the superficial choroid and clinical angiography images for regions of GA. Abnormalities and vascular dropout observed within the choriocapillaris for pvOCT are compared with regional GA progression.

Earlier studies demonstrated that the transdermal fluorescent probe distribution over a 2 x 2 mm skin area was well represented by a significantly reduced sampling of the 400 microscale skin sites (100 x 100 microm) constituting the wide area. In the present study, the 400 microscale skin sites are considered individually, and the site-to-site variability in permeant distributions is used as a model to reflect the range in experimentally measured skin permeabilities resulting from the inherent stratum corneum structural heterogeneity. The correlation established between the permeant surface intensity and the corresponding permeant intensity gradient at each skin site provides an indication of the potential for screening transdermal permeant distributions solely based on the evaluation of microscale permeant surface intensities. The strong linear correlation between the intensity gradient and the surface intensity for the hydrophilic model permeant, sulforhodamine B, demonstrated that surface intensities provide a robust indicator of the corresponding transdermal probe distributions at the microscale. For the hydrophobic model permeant, rhodamine B hexyl ester, however, weak correlations were observed between these two parameters.

Using fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) and phasor analysis to measure endogenous retinoic acid (RA) directly in vivo, we have investigated the amplitude of noise in RA signaling, and how modulation of this noise affects patterning of hindbrain segments (rhombomeres) in the zebrafish embryo. We demonstrate that RA forms a noisy gradient during critical stages of hindbrain patterning and that cells use distinct intracellular binding proteins to attenuate noise in RA levels. Increasing noise disrupts sharpening of rhombomere boundaries and proper patterning of the hindbrain. These findings reveal novel cellular mechanisms of noise regulation, which are likely to play important roles in other aspects of physiology and disease., DOI:\\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14034.001, Animal cells need to be able to communicate with each other so that they can work together in tissues and organs. To do so, cells release signaling molecules that can move around within a tissue and be detected by receptors on other cells., We tend to assume that the signaling molecules are evenly distributed across a tissue and affect all the receiving cells in the same way. However, random variations (noise) that affect how many of these molecules are produced, how they move through the space between cells and how they bind to receptors makes the reality much more complex. Cells responding to the signal somehow can ignore this noise and establish sharp boundaries between different cell types so that neighboring cells have distinct roles in the tissue. Few studies have attempted to measure such noise or address how cells manage to respond to noisy signals in a consistent manner., Retinoic acid is a signaling molecule that plays an important role in the development of the brain in animal embryos. It forms a gradient along the body of the embryo from the head end to the tail end, but it has proved difficult to measure this gradient directly. Sosnik et al. exploited the fact that this molecule is weakly fluorescent and used microscopy to directly detect it in zebrafish embryos. The experiments show that retinoic acid forms a gradient in the embryos, with high levels at the tail end and lower levels at the head end., Sosnik et al. also found that there is a large amount of noise in the retinoic acid gradient. Two cells in the same position can have very different retinoic acid levels, and the levels in a particular cell can vary from one minute to the next. The experiments also show that proteins that interact with retinoic acid help to reduce noise within a cell. This noise reduction is important for sharpening the boundaries between different brain regions in the embryo to allow the brain to develop normally. A future challenge will be to see if similar retinoic acid gradients and noise control occur in other tissues, and if the noise has any positive role to play in development., DOI:\\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14034.002', u'issn': u'2050-084X', 'ENTRYTYPE': u'article', u'volume': u'5', u'link': u'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4829421/', u'file': u'PubMed Central Full Text PDF:C\\\\:\\\\\\\\Users\\\\\\\\lociuser\\\\\\\\Zotero\\\\\\\\storage\\\\\\\\3LT2RBCB\\\\\\\\Sosnik et al. - Noise modulation in retinoic acid signaling sharpe.pdf:application/pdf', u'urldate': u'2017-11-22', u'pmid': u'27067377', 'ID': 'sosnik_noise_nodate', u'journal': u'eLife', u'pmcid': u'PMC4829421'}\n",

Previously, our laboratory showed that ECM of 2D coatings can trigger differentiation of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into mesodermal lineages in an ECM-specific manner over 14 days, in some cases comparable to chemical induction. To test whether a similar effect was possible in a 3D, tissue-like environment, we designed a synthetic-natural biomaterial composite. The composite can present whole-molecule ECM proteins to cells, even those that do not spontaneously form hydrogels ex vivo, in 3D. To this end, we entrapped collagen type I, laminin-111, or fibronectin in ECM composites with MSCs and directly compared markers of mesodermal differentiation including cardiomyogenic (ACTC1), osteogenic (SPP1), adipogenic (PPARG), and chondrogenic (SOX9) in 2D versus 3D. We found the 3D condition largely mimicked the 2D condition such that the addition of type I collagen was the most potent inducer of differentiation to all lineages tested. One notable difference between 2D and 3D was pronounced adipogenic differentiation in 3D especially in the presence of exogenous collagen type I. In particular, PPARG gene expression was significantly increased \\u223c16-fold relative to chemical induction, in 3D and not in 2D. Unexpectedly, 3D engagement of ECM proteins also altered immunomodulatory function of MSCs in that expression of IL-6 gene was elevated relative to basal levels in 2D. In fact, levels of IL-6 gene expression in 3D composites containing exogenously supplied collagen type I or fibronectin were statistically similar to levels attained in 2D with tumor necrosis factor-\\u03b1 (TNF-\\u03b1) stimulation and these levels were sustained over a 2-week period. Thus, this novel biomaterial platform allowed us to compare the biochemical impact of whole-molecule ECM proteins in 2D versus 3D indicating enhanced adipogenic differentiation and IL-6 expression of MSC in the 3D context. Exploiting the biochemical impact of ECM proteins on MSC differentiation and immunomodulation could augment the therapeutic utility of MSCs.', u'issn': u'2164-7844', u'number': u'1', u'pages': u'37--48', u'volume': u'5', u'keyword': u'biomaterials, extracellular matrix, stem cells', 'ID': 'jung_heterogeneous_2016', u'year': u'2016', u'pmid': u'26862471', u'journal': u'BioResearch Open Access', u'pmcid': u'PMC4744874'}\n",

Ultraviolet light, including low-energy UVA (32-400 nm) radiation, as well as high-intensity near infrared (NIR) laser radiation may induce cell damage.

Low-power (1.5 mW, 5.3 W/cm2) UVA exposure with 365 nm radiation of a standard mercury microscopy lamp to human spermatozoa resulted within 109 +/- 30 s in paralysis and within 310 +/- 110 s in cell death. Cytotoxic effects during cell manipulation with laser microbeams were found to be partly based on non-linear excitation phenomena, in particular two-photon absorption by endogenous cell chromophores.

In contrast, laser microbeams at 800-1064 nm may act as relatively safe micromanipulation tools. In most optical traps multifrequency cw lasers are employed. Radiation of these lasers can magnify cytotoxic effects. Therefore, single-frequency laser operation should be preferred.

Although trastuzumab reduces production of the angiogenic factor VEGF in HER2 + tumors, the acute and sustained effects of trastuzumab on the tumor vasculature are not understood fully, particularly in trastuzumab-resistant tumors. We used mouse models of trastuzumab sensitive and trastuzumab-resistant HER2 + breast cancers to measure dynamic changes in tumor microvessel density and hemoglobin oxygenation (sO2) in vivo using quantitative hyperspectral imaging at 2, 5, 9, and 14 days after antibody treatment. Further analysis quantified the distribution of microvessels into low and high oxygenation groups, and monitored changes in these distributions with trastuzumab treatment.

When functioning normally, mature heart valves prevent intracardiac retrograde blood flow; before valves develop, there is considerable regurgitation, resulting in reversing (or oscillatory) flows between the atrium and ventricle. As reversing flows are particularly strong stimuli to endothelial cells in culture, an attractive hypothesis is that heart valves form as a developmental response to retrograde blood flows through the maturing heart. Here, we exploit the relationship between oscillatory flow and heart rate to manipulate the amount of retrograde flow in the atrioventricular (AV) canal before and during valvulogenesis, and find that this leads to arrested valve growth. Using this manipulation, we determined that klf2a is normally expressed in the valve precursors in response to reversing flows, and is dramatically reduced by treatments that decrease such flows. Experimentally knocking down the expression of this shear-responsive gene with morpholine antisense oligonucleotides (MOs) results in dysfunctional valves. Thus, klf2a expression appears to be necessary for normal valve formation. This, together with its dependence on intracardiac hemodynamic forces, makes klf2a expression an early and reliable indicator of proper valve development. Together, these results demonstrate a critical role for reversing flows during valvulogenesis and show how relatively subtle perturbations of normal hemodynamic patterns can lead to both major alterations in gene expression and severe valve dysgenesis., The growth and development of vertebrates are critically dependent on efficient cardiac output to drive blood circulation. An essential step of heart development is the formation of heart valves, whose leaflets are made through a complex set of cellular rearrangements of endothelial cells. Endothelial cells experience high flow forces as blood circulates. Moreover, heart valves and associated structures can be malformed when flow forces are abnormal, suggesting that these flow forces are in fact required for proper valve formation. Whether it is the force of the blood flow, its directionality (forward or reverse), or both that are important is not clear. We studied the interplay during valve development between key genes known to be involved in the process and epigenetic influences such as flow forces. Using zebrafish, whose optical clarity allows analyzing blood flow patterns at high resolution, we identified the presence of reversing flows specifically at the level of valve precursors. By manipulating blood flow patterns, we show that reversing flows are essential for valve morphogenesis. Specifically, we show that the expression of the gene klf2a depends on the presence of reversing flows and is required for valve development. We predict that by influencing levels of klf2a, reversing flows constitute an important stimulus controlling the appropriate biological responses of endothelial cells during valve formation.', u'issn': u'1544-9173', u'number': u'11', u'month': u'nov', u'volume': u'7', u'link': u'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2773122/', u'file': u'PubMed Central Full Text PDF:C\\\\:\\\\\\\\Users\\\\\\\\lociuser\\\\\\\\Zotero\\\\\\\\storage\\\\\\\\TKJYMYA4\\\\\\\\Vermot et al. - 2009 - Reversing Blood Flows Act through klf2a to Ensure .pdf:application/pdf', u'year': u'2009', u'urldate': u'2017-11-23', u'pmid': u'19924233', 'ID': 'vermot_reversing_2009', u'journal': u'PLoS Biology', u'pmcid': u'PMC2773122'}\n",

In this study, we applied AFIC to identify cancer-associated human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes 16 and 18 in individual cells of cervical smears using a sensitive fluorescence based in situ hybridization (FISH) assay. HPV sequences were labeled by FISH and the cells imaged using an epi-fluorescence microscope coupled to a low-light color CCD camera. Before application to clinical specimens, AFIC was assessed using fluorescent calibration beads and cervical cancer cell lines containing known numbers of integrated HPV genomes per nucleus. Assessment showed that our AFIC had a linear response, was quantitatively accurate, and had the sensitivity to detect one HPV genome per nucleus. After acquisition of images, computer algorithms identified every cell nucleus (via a fluorescent DNA counterstain) and quantified the FISH signal per nucleus. AFIC was employed to screen 27 patient specimens for HPV 16/18, of which 12 were positive. The HPV status of the specimens positively correlated with the pathological diagnosis, and since AFIC automatically and correctly located every cell, it was possible to directly compare morphology and HPV status in the same cell.

In an earlier article, we described the design, development, and optimization phases of the FLTM before reporting its performances in a variety of viscoelastic materials. In the work presented here, we demonstrate the suitability of FLTM to study local cellular rheology and obtain values for the storage and loss moduli G'(omega) and G''(omega) of fibroblasts consistent with past literature. We further establish that chemically induced cytoskeletal disruption is accompanied by reduced cellular stiffness and viscosity. Next, we provide a systematic study of some experimental variables that may critically influence microrheology measurements. First, we interrogate and justify the relevance of bead endocytosis as a method of cellular internalization of 1-microm probes in FLTM. Second, we show that as sample temperature increases, FLTM findings are elevated toward higher frequencies. Third, we confirm that relevant bead sizes (1 and 2 microm) have no effect on FLTM measurements. Fourth, we report the lack of influence of bead coatings (antiintegrin, antitransferrin, antidystroglycan, or uncoated tracers were surveyed) on their rheological readouts. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of FLTM in studying how substratum rigidity regulates cellular rheological properties. Interestingly, multiple, coupled strain relaxation mechanisms can be observed separated by two plateau moduli. Although these observations can be partly explained by rheological theories describing entangled actin filaments, there is a clear need to extend existing microrheology models to the cytoskeleton, including potentially important factors such as network geometry and remodeling.\", u'issn': u'1542-0086', u'number': u'2', u'month': u'jul', u'volume': u'95', u'pages': u'895--909', u'keyword': u'Animals, Mice, NIH 3T3 Cells, Cytoskeleton, Mechanotransduction, Cellular, Microscopy, Fluorescence, Microfluidics, Lasers', u'author': u'Jonas, Maxine and Huang, Hayden and Kamm, Roger D. and So, Peter T.

Wall shear stress estimates are obtained by solving the momentum integral equation using the method proposed by Walz and applying this method to various stenosis geometries for Reynolds numbers (Re) of Re = 59-1000. Elevated wall shear stress may be of importance when considering thrombosis and vascular erosion in stenosis, as well as the potential for debris from the stenotic area to 'break away' and cause further pathology. The values of shear stress obtained using the model in this study agree well with published values of wall shear stress. When compared to a previously published boundary layer model utilizing the Thwaites method (Reese and Thompson, 1998), the model proposed herein performs better at higher Re while the model utilizing the Thwaites method performs better at lower Re. Wall shear stresses are shown to increase with increasing stenosis (increased area reduction) for a given stenosis length, increase with increasing Re for a given stenosis geometry, and increase for steeper stenosis of the same constriction. The boundary layer model proposed can be easily implemented by clinical researchers to provide in vivo estimates of wall shear stress through arterial stenoses.\", u'issn': u'0006-355X', u'number': u'6', u'pages': u'743--754', u'volume': u'39', u'keyword': u'Humans, Stress, Mechanical, Arteries, Arteriosclerosis, Constriction, Pathologic, Mathematics, Models, Cardiovascular', u'year': u'2002', u'pmid': u'12454440', u'journal': u'Biorheology', 'ID': 'provenzano_boundary_2002'}\n",

By simultaneously performing redox ratio and fluorescence imaging, a high degree of correlation between the PN/(Fp+PN) redox ratio, where PN denotes reduced pyridine nucleotides (NADH) and Fp denotes oxidized flavoproteins, and the Pyro-2DG uptake was found in both murine tumor models, indicating that Pyro-2DG could serve as an extrinsic NIR fluorescent metabolic index for the tumors.

Expression of collagen I, collagen IV, and laminin mRNAs in the mammary gland during puberty corresponded to the period of greatest growth of the gland, 4-7 weeks postnatally. Collagen I expression preceded collagen IV expression, both of which preceded laminin expression, suggesting an important temporal sequence of extracellular matrix (ECM) production. When growth of the epithelium ceased in the adult virgin gland, expression of all three mRNAs became undetectable. Following the onset of pregnancy these molecules were re-expressed with the same chronology observed during puberty. Collagen I, collagen IV, and laminin were expressed by stromal cells immediately surrounding the developing ductal epithelium. Surprisingly, we found no expression of ECM components in the epithelial cells, suggesting the mammary epithelium does not synthesize its own basement membrane. The distribution of collagen I was consistent with a role in duct formation, since collagen I was strikingly abundant around larger mammary ducts, but was sparse around growing endbuds or alveoli. Conversely, there was abundant laminin near growing endbuds and around alveoli, and less around large ducts, suggesting its role is different than collagen I. The alpha 2 beta 1 integrin was present on the basal, lateral, and apical surfaces of the mammary epithelium throughout postnatal development and pregnancy. The alpha 2 beta 1 integrin expression was strongest at midpregnancy, suggesting a role for alpha 2 beta 1 integrin in the alveolar formation that occurs at this time. The alpha 2 beta 1 integrin expression decreased dramatically in the lactating gland.

The waves are modulated by cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) activity and require the Rho GEF (guanine nucleotide exchange factor), Ect2.

Previous treatment attempts have been unsuccessful. After a pioneering single treatment we now report the outcome of the complete first cohort of patients receiving substitution treatment with cyclic pyranopterin monophosphate (cPMP), a biosynthetic precursor of the cofactor.\\nMETHODS: In this observational prospective cohort study, newborn babies with clinical and biochemical evidence of MoCD were admitted to a compassionate-use programme at the request of their treating physicians. Intravenous cPMP (80-320 \\u03bcg/kg per day) was started in neonates diagnosed with MoCD (type A and type B) following a standardised protocol. We prospectively monitored safety and efficacy in all patients exposed to cPMP.\\nFINDINGS: Between June 6, 2008, and Jan 9, 2013, intravenous cPMP was started in 16 neonates diagnosed with MoCD (11 type A and five type B) and continued in eight type A patients for up to 5 years. We observed no drug-related serious adverse events after more than 6000 doses. The disease biomarkers urinary S-sulphocysteine, xanthine, and urate returned to almost normal concentrations in all type A patients within 2 days, and remained normal for up to 5 years on continued cPMP substitution. Eight patients with type A disease rapidly improved under treatment and convulsions were either completely suppressed or substantially reduced. Three patients treated early remain seizure free and show near-normal long-term development. We detected no biochemical or clinical response in patients with type B disease.\\nINTERPRETATION: cPMP substitution is the first effective therapy for patients with MoCD type A and has a favourable safety profile. Restoration of molybdenum cofactor-dependent enzyme activities results in a greatly improved neurodevelopmental outcome when started sufficiently early. The possibility of MoCD type A needs to be urgently explored in every encephalopathic neonate to avoid any delay in appropriate cPMP substitution, and to maximise treatment benefit.\\nFUNDING: German Ministry of Education and Research; Orphatec/Colbourne Pharmaceuticals.', u'issn': u'1474-547X', u'number': u'10007', u'month': u'nov', u'volume': u'386', u'pages': u'1955--1963', u'keyword': u'Humans, Female, Male, Infant, Newborn, Treatment Outcome, Drug Administration Schedule, Cohort Studies, Compassionate Use Trials, Metal Metabolism, Inborn Errors, Organophosphorus Compounds, Pterins', u'author': u'Schwahn, Bernd C. and Van Spronsen, Francjan J. and Belaidi, Abdel A. and Bowhay, Stephen and Christodoulou, John and Derks, Terry G. and Hennermann, Julia B. and Jameson, Elisabeth and K\\xf6nig, Kai and McGregor, Tracy L. and Font-Montgomery, Esperanza and Santamaria-Araujo, Jos\\xe9 A. and Santra, Saikat and Vaidya, Mamta and Vierzig, Anne and Wassmer, Evangeline and Weis, Ilona and Wong, Flora Y. and Veldman, Alex and Schwarz, G\\xfcnter', u'year': u'2015', u'pmid': u'26343839', u'journal': u'Lancet (London, England)', 'ID': 'schwahn_efficacy_2015'}\n",

The advantage of such approaches is quantification of potential diagnostic parameters from the fluorescence emission signal, whereby the traditional descriptive staging process is complemented by measurements of fluorescence intensity, lifetime, and spectra. We explored whether the clinical \"gold standard\" of eosin and hematoxylin stained histology slides would provide optical biomarker signatures of diagnostic value. Alternatively, we examined unstained slides for changes in intensity and/or fluorescence lifetime of relevant endogenous fluorophores. Although eosin provided a strong emission signal and had distinct spectra and lifetime, we found that it was not useful as a fluorescent biological marker, particularly when combined with hematoxylin. Instead, we found that the properties of the fluorescence from the endogenous fluorophores NADH and FAD were indicative of the pathological state of the tissue. Comparing regions of carcinoma in situ to adjacent histologically normal regions, we found that tumor cells produced higher intensity and had a longer fluorescence lifetime. By imaging at 780 nm and 890 nm excitation, we were able to differentiate the fluorescence of FAD from NADH by separating the emission spectra. The shift to a longer lifetime in tumor cells was independent of the free or bound state of FAD and NADH, and of the excitation wavelength.

In this study we demonstrate that decorin, a small dermatan sulfate proteoglycan, regulates extracellular matrix remodeling in rabbit synovial fibroblasts adhering to vitronectin. Decorin induced the expression of the matrix metalloproteinase collagenase (MMP-1) when present on the substrate with vitronectin, or with the 120-kDa cell-binding domain of fibronectin, but not when present with intact fibronectin or Type I collagen. Secreted collagenase was detected within 8 h of adhesion, there was no associated alteration in cell shape or focal contact formation in cells adhering to decorin plus vitronectin, whereas cell rounding was observed in cells adhering to decorin plus the 120-kDa fragment of fibronectin. The core protein of decorin, but not the glycosaminoglycan moiety, was sufficient to induce collagenase expression on both substrates; however, the glycosaminoglycan moiety of decorin as well as the core were required for cell rounding observed in cells adhering to the 120-kDa domain of fibronectin. The collagenase-inducing effect of decorin seems to be independent of its effects on transforming growth factor-beta, as function-blocking antibodies against transforming growth factor-beta did not interfere with the collagenase-inducing effects of decorin. These data indicate that decorin has specific gene regulatory effects in cells when present in the matrix with vitronectin or the 120-kDa fragment of fibronectin, polypeptides that are present in actively remodeling tissues.

To assist biologists working across a broad spectrum of organisms, we demonstrate multiplexed in situ HCR in diverse imaging settings: bacteria, whole-mount nematode larvae, whole-mount fruit fly embryos, whole-mount sea urchin embryos, whole-mount zebrafish larvae, whole-mount chicken embryos, whole-mount mouse embryos and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded human tissue sections. In addition to straightforward multiplexing, in situ HCR enables deep sample penetration, high contrast and subcellular resolution, providing an incisive tool for the study of interlaced and overlapping expression patterns, with implications for research communities across the biological sciences., Summary: Multiplexed in situ hybridisation chain reaction allows visualisation of multiple mRNAs in a single sample with subcellular resolution.

Although the nature, origin, and variety of such cues have long been obscure, one component is certainly the Rho activator Ect2. Here we describe the behavior and function of Ect2 in echinoderm embryos, showing that Ect2 migrates from spindle midzone to astral microtubules in anaphase and that Ect2 shapes the pattern of Rho activation in incipient furrows. Our key finding is that Ect2 and its binding partner Cyk4 accumulate not only at normal furrows, but also at furrows that form in the absence of associated spindle, midzone, or chromosomes. In all these cases, the cell assembles essentially the same cytokinetic signaling ensemble\\u2014opposed astral microtubules decorated with Ect2 and Cyk4.

While the in vitro screening methods have the advantage of providing direct access to the genetic information encoding unknown protein partners, they do not allow direct access to interactions of these protein partners in their natural environment inside the living cell. Using wide-field, confocal, or two-photon (2p) fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) microscopy, this information can be obtained from living cells and tissues with nanometer resolution. One of the important conditions for FRET to occur is the overlap of the emission spectrum of the donor with the absorption spectrum of the acceptor. As a result of spectral overlap, the FRET signal is always contaminated by donor emission into the acceptor channel and by the excitation of acceptor molecules by the donor excitation wavelength. Mathematical algorithms are required to correct the spectral bleed-through signal in wide-field, confocal, and two-photon FRET microscopy. In contrast, spectral bleed-through is not an issue in FRET/FLIM imaging because only the donor fluorophore lifetime is measured; also, fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) measurements are independent of excitation intensity or fluorophore concentration. The combination of FRET and FLIM provides high spatial (nanometer) and temporal (nanosecond) resolution when compared to intensity-based FRET imaging.

The mechanisms of this process are poorly understood, particularly in 3D, in part because of the lack of efficient methods to generate aligned collagen matrices. To address this technological gap, we propose a simple method to align collagen gels using guided cellular compaction. Our method yields highly aligned, acellular collagen constructs with predictable microstructural features, thus providing a controlled microenvironment for in\\xa0vitro experiments. Quantifying cell behavior in these anisotropic constructs, we find that breast carcinoma cells are acutely sensitive to the direction and extent of collagen alignment. Further, live cell imaging and analysis of 3D cell migration reveals that alignment of collagen does not alter the total motility of breast cancer cells, but simply redirects their migration to produce largely one-dimensional movement. However, a profoundly enhanced motility in aligned collagen matrices is observed for the subpopulation of carcinoma cells with high tumor initiating and metastatic capacity, termed cancer stem cells (CSCs). Analysis of the biophysical determinants of cell migration show that nuclear deformation is not a critical factor associated with the observed increases in motility for CSCs. Rather, smaller cell size, a high degree of phenotypic plasticity, and increased protrusive activity emerge as vital facilitators of rapid, contact-guided migration of CSCs in aligned 3D collagen matrices.', u'issn': u'1542-0086', u'number': u'5', u'month': u'mar', u'volume': u'112', u'pages': u'1023--1036', u'keyword': u'Cell Line, Tumor, Cell Movement, Collagen, Extracellular Matrix, Humans, Neoplastic Stem Cells, Phenotype', 'ID': 'ray_enhanced_2017', u'year': u'2017', u'pmid': u'28297639', u'journal': u'Biophysical Journal', u'pmcid': u'PMC5355487'}\n",

However, the mechanisms that regulate synovial fibroblast invasion are not well understood. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) has been implicated in cellular invasion in several cell types, and FAK inhibitors are in clinical trials for cancer treatment. Little is known about the role of FAK in inflammatory arthritis, but, given its expression in synovial tissue, its known role in invasion in other cells and the potential clinical availability of FAK inhibitors, it is important to determine if FAK contributes to synovial fibroblast invasion and inflammatory arthritis.\\nMETHODS: After treatment with FAK inhibitors, invasiveness of human rheumatoid synovial fibroblasts was determined with Matrigel invasion chambers. Migration and focal matrix degradation, two components of cellular invasion, were assessed in FAK-inhibited rheumatoid synovial fibroblasts by transwell assay and microscopic examination of fluorescent gelatin degradation, respectively. Using mice with tumor necrosis factor \\u03b1 (TNF\\u03b1)-induced arthritis in which fak could be inducibly deleted, invasion and migration by FAK-deficient murine arthritic synovial fibroblasts were determined as described above and arthritis was clinically and pathologically scored in FAK-deficient mice.\\nRESULTS: Inhibition of FAK in human rheumatoid synovial fibroblasts impaired cellular invasion and migration. Focal matrix degradation occurred both centrally and at focal adhesions, the latter being a novel site for matrix degradation in synovial fibroblasts, but degradation was unaltered with FAK inhibitors. Loss of FAK reduced invasion in murine arthritic synovial fibroblasts, but not migration or TNF\\u03b1-induced arthritis severity and joint erosions.\\nCONCLUSIONS: FAK inhibitors reduce synovial fibroblast invasion and migration, but synovial fibroblast migration and TNF\\u03b1-induced arthritis do not rely on FAK itself.

Hence, the overarching goal of this research was to address this issue by developing a biomaterial system that enables controlled, dual delivery of pro-angiogenic C16 and anti-inflammatory Ac-SDKP peptides in a minimally-invasive way. To achieve the goal, a peptide-loaded injectable microgel system was developed and tested in a mouse model of PAD. When delivered through multiple, low volume injections, the combination of C16 and Ac-SDKP peptides promoted angiogenesis, muscle regeneration, and perfusion recovery, while minimizing detrimental inflammation. Additionally, this peptide combination regulated inflammatory TNF-\\u03b1 pathways independently of MMP-9 mediated pathways of angiogenesis in\\xa0vitro, suggesting a potential mechanism by which angiogenic and inflammatory responses can be uncoupled in the context of PAD. This study demonstrates a translatable potential of the dual peptide-loaded injectable microgel system for PAD treatment.', u'issn': u'1878-5905', u'number': u'36', u'month': u'dec', u'volume': u'35', u'pages': u'9635--9648', u'keyword': u'Animals, Mice, Inflammation, Matrix Metalloproteinase 9, Cell Line, Oligopeptides, Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha, Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells, Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Peripheral Arterial Disease, Angiogenesis, Angiogenesis Inducing Agents, Drug Carriers, Injections, Matrix Metalloproteinase Inhibitors, Neovascularization, Physiologic, Peptide, Polycaprolactone, Polyesters, Polyethylene glycol, Polymer', 'ID': 'zachman_uncoupling_2014', u'year': u'2014', u'pmid': u'25154665', u'journal': u'Biomaterials', u'pmcid': u'PMC4164579'}\n",

We approached this question by drawing an analogy to mitotic exit in budding yeast, as asymmetric spindle attachment to the appropriate cortical region is the common regulatory cue. In budding yeast, the small G protein Cdc42 plays an important role in mitotic exit following the spindle pole attachment []. We show here that inhibition of Cdc42 activation blocks polar body formation. The oocytes initiate anaphase but fail to properly form and direct a contractile ring. Endogenous Cdc42 is activated at the spindle pole-cortical contact site immediately prior to polar body formation. The cortical Cdc42 activity zone, which directly overlays the spindle pole, is circumscribed by a cortical RhoA activity zone; the latter defines the cytokinetic contractile furrow []. As the RhoA ring contracts during cytokinesis, the Cdc42 zone expands, maintaining its complementary relationship with the RhoA ring.

Selective desorption of redundant particles was employed to obtain a given particle pattern from preadsorbed particle layers. Microparticle desorption was regulated by dielectrophoretic attracting forces generated by individual pixel electrodes, tangential detaching forces of an air flow, and adhesion forces on the microchip surface. A theoretical consideration of the acting forces showed that without pixel voltage, the tangential force applied for particle detachment exceeded the particle adhesion force. When the pixel voltage was switched on, however, the sum of attracting forces was larger than the tangential detaching force, which was crucial for desorption efficiency. In our experiments, appropriately large dielectrophoretic forces were achieved by applying high voltages of up to 100 V on the pixel electrodes. In addition, electrode geometries on the chip's surface as well as particle size influenced the desorption quality.

Although HR is mostly error free, inherent or environmental conditions that either suppress or induce HR cause genomic instability. Despite its importance in carcinogenesis, due to limitations in our ability to detect HR in vivo, little is known about HR in mammalian tissues. Here, we describe a mouse model in which a direct repeat HR substrate is targeted to the ubiquitously expressed Rosa26 locus. In the Rosa26 Direct Repeat-GFP (RaDR-GFP) mice, HR between two truncated EGFP expression cassettes can yield a fluorescent signal. In-house image analysis software provides a rapid method for quantifying recombination events within intact tissues, and the frequency of recombinant cells can be evaluated by flow cytometry. A comparison among 11 tissues shows that the frequency of recombinant cells varies by more than two orders of magnitude among tissues, wherein HR in the brain is the lowest. Additionally, de novo recombination events accumulate with age in the colon, showing that this mouse model can be used to study the impact of chronic exposures on genomic stability. Exposure to N-methyl-N-nitrosourea, an alkylating agent similar to the cancer chemotherapeutic temozolomide, shows that the colon, liver and pancreas are susceptible to DNA damage-induced HR. Finally, histological analysis of the underlying cell types reveals that pancreatic acinar cells and liver hepatocytes undergo HR and also that HR can be specifically detected in colonic somatic stem cells.

Noise level measurements for continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) devices demonstrated that these constantly exceed current recommendations. The use of high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) as an alternative non-invasive ventilation modality has become more popular in recent years in neonatal care.\\nOBJECTIVE: To study noise levels of two HFNC devices commonly used in newborns. As a comparison, noise levels of a continuous flow CPAP device were also studied.\\nMETHODS: In-vitro study. The noise levels of two contemporary HFNC devices (Fisher \\\\& Paykel NHF\\u2122 and Vapotherm Precision Flow\\xae) and one CPAP device (Dr\\xe4ger Babylog\\xae 8000 plus) were measured in the oral cavity of a newborn manikin in an incubator in a quiet environment. HFNC flows of 4-8 l/min and CPAP pressures of 4-8 cm H2O were applied. The CPAP flow was set at 8 l/min as per unit practice.\\nRESULTS: Vapotherm HFNC generated the highest noise levels, measuring 81.2-91.4 dB(A) with increasing flow. Fisher \\\\& Paykel HFNC noise levels were between 78.8 and 81.2 dB(A). The CPAP device generated the lowest noise levels between 73.9 and 77.4 dB(A).\\nCONCLUSIONS: Both HFNC devices generated higher noise levels than the CPAP device. All noise levels were far above current recommendations of the American Academy of Pediatrics.

We find that Scribble is required for oriented cell division and that its function in this process is independent of canonical apico-basal and planar polarity pathways. We identify a role for Scribble in controlling clustering of \\u03b1-Catenin foci in dividing progenitors. Loss of either Scrib or of N-cadherin results in abnormally oriented mitoses, reduced cross-midline cell divisions and similar neural tube defects. We propose that Scribble-dependent nascent cell-cell adhesion clusters between neuroepithelial progenitors contribute to define orientation of their cell division.

For measurements on living cells, image correlation spectroscopy (ICS) and temporal ICS extend the FCS approach to diffusion times as long as seconds to minutes and simultaneously provide spatially resolved dynamic information. However, ICS is limited to very slow dynamics due to the frame acquisition rate. Here we develop novel extensions to ICS that probe spatial correlations in previously inaccessible temporal windows. We show that using standard laser confocal imaging techniques (raster-scan mode) not only can we reach the temporal scales of single-point FCS, but also have the advantages of ICS in providing spatial information. This novel method, called raster image correlation spectroscopy (RICS), rapidly measures during the scan many focal points within the cell providing the same concentration and dynamic information of FCS as well as information on the spatial correlation between points along the scanning path. Longer time dynamics are recovered from the information in successive lines and frames. We exploit the hidden time structure of the scan method in which adjacent pixels are a few microseconds apart thereby accurately measuring dynamic processes such as molecular diffusion in the microseconds-to-seconds timescale. In conjunction with simulated data, we show that a wide range of diffusion coefficients and concentrations can be measured by RICS. We used RICS to determine for the first time spatially resolved diffusions of paxillin-EGFP stably expressed in CHOK1 cells.

It can catalyze NADH-dependent reduction of S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO); as well as NAD(+)-dependent oxidation of hydroxymethylglutathione (HMGSH; an adduct formed by the spontaneous reaction between formaldehyde and glutathione). While initially recognized as the enzyme that is involved in formaldehyde detoxification, increasing amount of evidence has shown that GSNOR also plays a significant role in nitric oxide mediated signaling through its modulation of protein S-nitrosothiol signaling. In humans, GSNOR/S-nitrosothiols have been implicated in the etiology of several diseases including lung cancer, cystic fibrosis, asthma, pulmonary hypertension, and neuronal dysfunction. Currently, it is not possible to monitor the activity of GSNOR in live cells. In this article, we present a new compound, O-aminobenzoyl-S-nitrosoglutathione (OAbz-GSNO), which acts as a fluorogenic pseudo-substrate for GSNOR with an estimated Km value of 320\\xb5M. The weak OAbz-GSNO fluorescence increases by approximately 14 fold upon reduction of its S-NO moiety. In live cell imaging studies, OAbz-GSNO is readily taken up by primary pulmonary endothelial cells and localizes to the same perinuclear region as GSNOR. The perinuclear OAbz-GSNO fluorescence increases in a time dependent manner and this increase in fluorescence is abolished by siRNA knockdown of GSNOR or by treatment with GSNOR-specific inhibitors N6022 and C3.

Because sequential analysis of the relevant driver mutations on fixated samples is challenging in terms of workload, tissue availability, and cost, we established multiplex parallel sequencing in routine diagnostics. The aim was to analyze all therapeutically relevant mutations in lung cancer samples in a high-throughput fashion while significantly reducing turnaround time and amount of input DNA compared with conventional dideoxy sequencing of single polymerase chain reaction amplicons.\\nMETHODS: In this study, we demonstrate the feasibility of a 102 amplicon multiplex polymerase chain reaction followed by sequencing on an Illumina sequencer on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue in routine diagnostics. Analysis of a validation cohort of 180 samples showed this approach to require significantly less input material and to be more reliable, robust, and cost-effective than conventional dideoxy sequencing. Subsequently, 2657 lung cancer patients were analyzed.\\nRESULTS: We observed that comprehensive biomarker testing provided novel information in addition to histological diagnosis and clinical staging. In 2657 consecutively analyzed lung cancer samples, we identified driver mutations at the expected prevalence. Furthermore we found potentially targetable DDR2 mutations at a frequency of 3\\\\% in both adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas.\\nCONCLUSION: Overall, our data demonstrate the utility of systematic sequencing analysis in a clinical routine setting and highlight the dramatic impact of such an approach on the availability of therapeutic strategies for the targeted treatment of individual cancer patients.', u'issn': u'1556-1380', u'number': u'7', u'month': u'jul', u'volume': u'10', u'pages': u'1049--1057', u'keyword': u'Humans, Biomarkers, Tumor, Lung Neoplasms, Polymerase Chain Reaction, DNA, Neoplasm, Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung, Cohort Studies, Sequence Analysis, DNA', u'year': u'2015', u'pmid': u'26102443', u'journal': u'Journal of Thoracic Oncology: Official Publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer', 'ID': 'konig_implementation_2015'}\n",

H. pylori survives in acidic conditions by producing urease, which catalyzes hydrolysis of urea to yield ammonia thus elevating the pH of its environment. However, the manner in which H. pylori is able to swim through the viscoelastic mucus gel that coats the stomach wall remains poorly understood. Previous rheology studies on gastric mucin, the key viscoelastic component of gastric mucus, indicate that the rheology of this material is pH dependent, transitioning from a viscous solution at neutral pH to a gel in acidic conditions. Bulk rheology measurements on porcine gastric mucin (PGM) show that pH elevation by H. pylori induces a dramatic decrease in viscoelastic moduli. Microscopy studies of the motility of H. pylori in gastric mucin at acidic and neutral pH in the absence of urea show that the bacteria swim freely at high pH, and are strongly constrained at low pH. By using two-photon fluorescence microscopy to image the bacterial motility in an initially low pH mucin gel with urea present we show that the gain of translational motility by bacteria is directly correlated with a rise in pH indicated by 2',7'-Bis-(2-Carboxyethyl)-5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF), a pH sensitive fluorescent dye.

Both methods, CLSM and MPT, were found to be suitable for in vivo imaging of superficial skin layers and may therefore be useful in dermatological practice for the diagnosis of skin diseases.

New live imaging modalities can provide insights into retinal organoid structure and metabolic function during in vitro growth. This study employed live tissue imaging to characterize retinal organoid development, including metabolic changes accompanying photoreceptor differentiation.\\n\\nMethods\\nLive hPSC-derived retinal organoids at different developmental stages were examined for microanatomic organization and metabolic function by phase contrast microscopy, optical coherence tomography (OCT), fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM), and hyperspectral imaging (HSpec). Features were compared to those revealed by histologic staining, immunostaining, and microcomputed tomography (micro-CT) of fixed organoid tissue.\\n\\nResults\\nWe used FLIM and HSpec to detect changes in metabolic activity as organoids differentiated into organized lamellae. FLIM detected increased glycolytic activity and HSpec detected retinol and retinoic acid accumulation in the organoid outer layer, coinciding with photoreceptor genesis. OCT enabled imaging of lamellae formed during organoid maturation. Micro-CT revealed three-dimensional structure, but failed to detect lamellae.\\n\\nConclusions\\nLive imaging modalities facilitate real-time and nondestructive imaging of retinal organoids as they organize into lamellar structures.

The relative red blood cell (RBC) flux in the tumor was assessed using the laser Doppler technique and the mean tumor pO2 measured continuously using O2-sensitive catheter electrodes. In a second series of experiments, the microregional distribution of the mitochondrial redox status and ATP concentration was measured.

Previous work has shown the proinflammatory capacity of the guidance cue semaphorin (Sema) 7a, but the role of one of its target receptors, the plexin C1 (PLXNC1) receptor is to date unknown. We report here that PLXNC1 is expressed outside the nervous system and induced during acute inflammation. PLXNC1(-/-) mice with C57BL/6 background demonstrated decreased inflammatory responses during zymosan A (ZyA)-induced peritonitis. Subsequent in vivo studies revealed altered rolling, adhesion, and transmigration properties of PLXNC1(-/-) leukocytes. Blockade of PLXNC1 was associated with attenuated chemotactic transendothelial migration properties in vitro. Studies in chimeric mice revealed that hematopoietic PLXNC1(-/-) animals demonstrated an attenuated inflammatory response. To probe the therapeutic potential of PLXNC1 we treated C57BL/6 WT mice with an anti-PLXNC1 antibody and a PLXNC1 binding peptide.

Psychological factors, however, are rarely considered. The present study involved 35 asymptomatic (AMI) and 35 symptomatic patients (SMI) selected from a sample of 199 patients with myocardial infarction. During observation in a rehabilitation clinic, the following were assessed: biochemical variables; ECG at rest, at exercise, and during Holter monitoring; and a special 23 h monitoring of physical activity, ECG changes, and subjective feelings. Psychological assessments with questionnaires were also performed and comprised: personality evaluation; physical complaints; possible predisposing features for the development of MI; expectations regarding the benefit of rehabilitation; circumstances at the time of infarction; and socioeconomic and historical data. The hypothesis that physiological factors might explain the differences between AMI and SMI is not substantiated by our results. However, the hypothesis of the role of psychological factors is supported.

Paxillin is an adaptor protein that localizes to focal adhesions and has been implicated in cell motility. We previously reported that calpain-mediated proteolysis of talin1 and focal adhesion kinase mediates adhesion disassembly in motile cells. To determine whether calpain-mediated paxillin proteolysis regulates focal adhesion dynamics and cell motility, we mapped the preferred calpain proteolytic site in paxillin. The cleavage site is between the paxillin LD1 and LD2 motifs and generates a C-terminal fragment that is similar in size to the alternative product paxillin delta. The calpain-generated proteolytic fragment, like paxillin delta, functions as a paxillin antagonist and impairs focal adhesion disassembly and migration. We generated mutant paxillin with a point mutation (S95G) that renders it partially resistant to calpain proteolysis. Paxillin-deficient cells that express paxillin S95G display increased turnover of zyxin-containing adhesions using time-lapse microscopy and also show increased migration. Moreover, cancer-associated somatic mutations in paxillin are common in the N-terminal region between the LD1 and LD2 motifs and confer partial calpain resistance.

Methods such as fluorescent speckle microscopy and spatial temporal image correlation spectroscopy have been used to capture high-resolution actin turnover dynamics within cells in two dimensions. However, these methods are not directly applicable in 3D due to lower resolution and poor contrast. Here, we propose to capture actin flow in 3D with high spatial-temporal resolution by combining nanoscale precise imaging by rapid beam oscillation and fluctuation spectroscopy techniques. To measure the actin flow along cell protrusions in cell expressing actin-eGFP cultured in a type I collagen matrix, the laser was orbited around the protrusion and its trajectory was modulated in a clover-shaped pattern perpendicularly to the protrusion. Orbits were also alternated at two positions closely spaced along the protrusion axis. The pair cross-correlation function was applied to the fluorescence fluctuation from these two positions to capture the flow of actin. Measurements done on nonmoving cellular protrusion tips showed no pair-correlation at two orbital positions indicating a lack of flow of F-actin bundles. However, in some protrusions, the pair-correlation approach revealed directional flow of F-actin bundles near the protrusion surface with flow rates in the range of \\u223c1 \\u03bcm/min, comparable to results in two dimensions using fluorescent speckle microscopy.

However, studies have demonstrated that cellular properties are local and can change dramatically on the basis of the location probed. Because membrane receptors are linked in various ways to the intracellular space, with some receptors linking to the cytoskeleton and others diffusing freely without apparent linkages, the cellular physical response to mechanical stresses is expected to depend on the receptor engaged. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that cellular mechanical stiffness as measured via cytoskeletally linked receptors is greater than stiffness measured via receptors that are not cytoskeletally linked. We used a magnetic micromanipulator to apply linear stresses to magnetic beads attached to living cells via selected receptors. One of the receptor classes probed, the dystroglycan receptors, is linked to the cytoskeleton, while the other, the transferrin receptors, is not. Fibronectin-coated beads were used to test cellular mechanical properties of the cytoskeleton without membrane dependence by allowing the beads to endocytose. For epithelial cells, transferrin-dependent stiffness and endocytosed bead-dependent stiffness were similar, while dystroglycan-dependent stiffness was significantly lower. For smooth muscle cells, dystroglycan-dependent stiffness was similar to the endocytosed bead-dependent stiffness, while the transferrin-dependent stiffness was lower. The conclusion of this study is that the measured cellular stiffness is critically influenced by specific receptor linkage and by cell type and raises the intriguing possibility of the existence of separate cytoskeletal networks with distinct mechanical properties that link different classes of receptors.', u'issn': u'0363-6143', u'number': u'1', u'month': u'jan', u'volume': u'288', u'pages': u'C72--80', u'keyword': u'Humans, Cytoskeleton, Focal Adhesions, Magnetics, Integrins, Stress, Mechanical, Non-NASA Center, Cell Line, NASA Discipline Cell Biology, Receptors, Cell Surface, Micromanipulation, Kidney, Dystroglycans, Hydrogen Bonding, Receptors, Transferrin', u'author': u'Huang, Hayden and Sylvan, Jeremy and Jonas, Maxine and Barresi, Rita and So, Peter T.

By imaging the spatiotemporal dynamics of the migratory and resident subsets of DCs in the SDLNs, we find that these two different populations play different roles in antigen presentation, with the migratory DCs being dramatically more potent in interacting with CD8+ T cells. This work offers critical insights into several areas, including optimizing vaccines for microbes and tumors., Dendritic cells (DCs) are antigen-presenting cells specialized for activating T cells to elicit effector T-cell functions. Cross-presenting DCs are a DC subset capable of presenting antigens to CD8+ T cells and play critical roles in cytotoxic T-cell\\u2013mediated immune responses to microorganisms and cancer. Although their importance is known, the spatiotemporal dynamics of cross-presenting DCs in vivo are incompletely understood. Here, we study the T-cell zone in skin-draining lymph nodes (SDLNs) and find it is compartmentalized into regions for CD8+ T-cell activation by cross-presenting DCs that express the chemokine (C motif) receptor 1 gene, Xcr1 and for CD4+ T-cell activation by CD11b+ DCs. Xcr1-expressing DCs in the SDLNs are composed of two different populations: migratory (CD103hi) DCs, which immigrate from the skin, and resident (CD8\\u03b1hi) DCs, which develop in the nodes. To characterize the dynamic interactions of these distinct DC populations with CD8+ T cells during their activation in vivo, we developed a photoconvertible reporter mouse strain, which permits us to distinctively visualize the migratory and resident subsets of Xcr1-expressing DCs. After leaving the skin, migratory DCs infiltrated to the deep T-cell zone of the SDLNs over 3 d, which corresponded to their half-life in the SDLNs. Intravital two-photon imaging showed that after soluble antigen immunization, the newly arriving migratory DCs more efficiently form sustained conjugates with antigen-specific CD8+ T cells than other Xcr1-expressing DCs in the SDLNs.

Cancer exhibits altered cellular metabolism, which affects the autofluorescence of metabolic cofactors NAD(P)H and FAD. The optical redox ratio (fluorescence intensity of NAD(P)H divided by FAD) reflects global cellular metabolism. The fluorescence lifetime (amount of time a fluorophore is in the excited state) is sensitive to microenvironment, particularly protein-binding. High-resolution imaging of the optical redox ratio and fluorescence lifetimes of NAD(P)H and FAD (optical metabolic imaging) enables single-cell analyses. In this study, mice with FaDu tumors were treated with the antibody therapy cetuximab or the chemotherapy cisplatin and imaged in vivo two days after treatment.

Using time-lapse microscopy, we show that enrichment of PIPKIgamma661 at the cell rear occurs early upon chemoattractant stimulation and is persistent during chemotaxis. Accordingly, we were able to detect enrichment of PtdIns(4,5)P(2) at the uropod during chemotaxis. Overexpression of kinase-dead PIPKIgamma661 compromised uropod formation and rear retraction similar to inhibition of ROCK signaling, suggesting that PtdIns(4,5)P(2) synthesis is important to elicit the backness response during chemotaxis. Together, our findings identify a previously unknown function for PIPKIgamma661 as a novel component of the backness signal that regulates rear retraction during chemotaxis.', u'issn': u'1059-1524', u'number': u'12', u'month': u'dec', u'volume': u'18', u'pages': u'5069--5080', u'keyword': u'Humans, Animals, Mice, Signal Transduction, Focal Adhesions, Cell Line, Cell Adhesion, Cell Polarity, Mice, Inbred C57BL, Neutrophils, Leukocytes, Chemotaxis, Genes, Reporter, Phosphatidylinositol Phosphates, Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)', 'ID': 'lokuta_type_2007', u'year': u'2007', u'pmid': u'17928408', u'journal': u'Molecular Biology of the Cell', u'pmcid': u'PMC2096574'}\n",

The nature of NKT-cell autoreactive activation remains poorly understood. We show here that the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is operative during human NKT-cell autoreactive activation, but calcium signaling is severely impaired. This results in a response that is biased toward granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) secretion because this cytokine requires extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling but is not highly calcium dependent, whereas interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), interleukin (IL)-4, and IL-2 production are minimal. Autoreactive activation was associated with reduced migration velocity but did not induce arrest; thus, NKT cells retained the ability to survey antigen presenting cells (APCs). IL-12 and IL-18 stimulated autoreactively activated NKT cells to secrete IFN-gamma, and this was mediated by Janus kinase-signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK-STAT)-dependent signaling without induction of calcium flux. This pathway did not require concurrent contact with CD1d(+) APCs but was strictly dependent on preceding autoreactive stimulation that induced ERK activation. In contrast, NKT-cell responses to the glycolipid antigen alpha-galactosyl ceramide (alpha-GalCer) were dampened by prior autoreactive activation. These results show that NKT-cell autoreactivity induces restricted cytokine secretion and leads to altered basal activation that potentiates innate responsiveness to costimulatory cytokines while modulating sensitivity to foreign antigens.', u'issn': u'1528-0020', u'number': u'10', u'month': u'nov', u'volume': u'112', u'pages': u'4128--4138', u'keyword': u'Humans, Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases, Cytokines, MAP Kinase Signaling System, Antigen-Presenting Cells, Lymphocyte Activation, T-Lymphocytes, Immunity, Innate, Antigens, CD1d, Autoantigens, Autoimmunity, Galactosylceramides, Janus Kinases, Killer Cells, Natural, STAT Transcription Factors', 'ID': 'wang_natural_2008', u'year': u'2008', u'pmid': u'18779390', u'journal': u'Blood', u'pmcid': u'PMC2581981'}\n",

We subjected these cells to 90 min of laminar fluid shear stress (10 dyn/cm(2)) and compared the PGE(2) and PGI(2) release and induction of cyclooxygenase-2 protein to control cells with intact cytoskeletons. Disruption of actin microfilaments, microtubules, or intermediate filaments in MC3T3-E1 cells did not prevent a significant fluid shear stress-induced release of PGE(2) or PGI(2). Furthermore, disruption of actin microfilaments or microtubules did not prevent a significant fluid shear stress-induced increase in cyclooxygenase-2 protein levels.

Advances in potential therapies have made it more important than ever to be able to adequately identify not only patients with particular genotypes (via patient registries) but also the medical professionals who provide care for them at particular specialist centres of expertise and who may be competent to participate in trials. Work within the neuromuscular field provides an example of how this may be achieved.\\nMETHODS: This paper describes the development of the TREAT-NMD Care and Trial Site Registry (CTSR), an initiative of an EU-funded Network of Excellence, and its utility in providing an infrastructure for clinical trial feasibility, recruitment, and other studies.\\nRESULTS: 285 CTSR-registered centres, reporting 35,495 neuromuscular patients, are described alongside an analysis of their provision for DMD. Site characteristics vary by country: the average number of DMD patients seen per site in the United States (96) is more than in Germany (25), and paediatric/adult breakdown is also markedly distinct. Over 70\\\\% of sites have previous trial experience, with a majority including a Clinical Trials Unit. Most sites also have MLPA diagnostic capability and access to a range of medical specialists. However, in the three countries reporting most sites (US, the UK and Germany), few had access to all core DMD specialists internally. Over 60\\\\% of sites did not report any form of transition arrangement.\\nCONCLUSIONS: Registries of care and trial sites have significant utility for research into rare conditions such as neuromuscular diseases, demonstrated by the significant engagement by industry and other researchers with the CTSR. We suggest that this approach may be applicable to other fields needing to identify centres of expertise with the potential to carry out clinical research and engage in clinical trials. Such registries also lend themselves to the developing context of European Reference Networks (ERNs), which seek to build networks of centres of expertise which fit specific criteria, and which may themselves aid the sustainability of such registries.

Using time-lapse microscopy, we show that the dynamics of green fluorescent protein-talin1 are impaired in FAK-deficient cells. Expression of wild-type but not calpain-resistant FAK rescues talin dynamics in FAK-deficient cells. Taken together, our findings suggest a novel role for calpain proteolysis of FAK in regulating adhesion dynamics in motile cells.', u'issn': u'1083-351X', u'number': u'15', u'month': u'apr', u'volume': u'285', u'pages': u'11418--11426', u'keyword': u'Cell Movement, Humans, Animals, Mice, Microscopy, Models, Biological, Green Fluorescent Proteins, Cell Adhesion, Gene Expression Regulation, Focal Adhesion Kinase 1, RNA, Small Interfering, Protein Structure, Tertiary, Binding Sites, Point Mutation, Caspases', 'ID': 'chan_regulation_2010', u'year': u'2010', u'pmid': u'20150423', u'journal': u'The Journal of Biological Chemistry', u'pmcid': u'PMC2857020'}\n",

However, the potential side effects of a LSD1-inhibitory therapy remain elusive. Here, we show, with a newly established conditional in vivo knockdown model, that LSD1 represents a central regulator of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. LSD1 knockdown (LSD1-kd) expanded progenitor numbers by enhancing their proliferative behavior. LSD1-kd led to an extensive expansion of granulomonocytic, erythroid and megakaryocytic progenitors. In contrast, terminal granulopoiesis, erythropoiesis and platelet production were severely inhibited. The only exception was monopoiesis, which was promoted by LSD1 deficiency. Importantly, we showed that peripheral blood granulocytopenia, monocytosis, anemia and thrombocytopenia were reversible after LSD1-kd termination. Extramedullary splenic hematopoiesis contributed to the phenotypic reversion, and progenitor populations remained expanded. LSD1-kd was associated with the upregulation of key hematopoietic genes, including Gfi1b, Hoxa9 and Meis1, which are known regulators of the HSC/progenitor compartment. We also demonstrated that LSD1-kd abrogated Gfi1b-negative autoregulation by crossing LSD1-kd with Gfi1b:GFP mice.

Classical analysis tools were not suitable for handling intrinsic signal non-stationarity. To overcome inherent obstacles we introduce a novel approach based upon wavelets.\\nMETHODS: During routine diagnostic volume pressure testing epidural ICP was acquired in 118 patients with suspected cerebrospinal fluid circulatory disorders. Pressure was digitised and conditioned to separate low frequent signal components ({\\\\textless}heart rate). ICP fluctuations were computed by subtraction of original and low frequent ICP constituents. Subsequently, multiresolution analysis was performed on fluctuations by discrete Haar wavelet transform and coefficients displayed in dyadic fashion (scalogram).\\nRESULTS: Decomposition of ICP fluctuations led to typical patterns in the scalogram. Episodes of pathological wave activity and artificial ICP changes were topographically detectable in the time frequency plane.\\nCONCLUSIONS: The wavelet approach is a simple yet powerful signal processing method to estimate both static and dynamic properties of ICP in various clinical scenarios.

The method is based on a feedback algorithm that controls the hardware of a two-photon laser scanning microscope in order to perform a circular orbit around the object to be tracked: the feedback mechanism will maintain the fluorescent object in the center by controlling the displacement of the scanning beam3-5.

Welfare schemes including locomotion assessments are increasingly being adopted, and more farmers and their veterinarians might implement a locomotion-scoring routine together. However, high within-observer agreement is a prerequisite for obtaining valid mobility scorings, and within-observer agreement cannot be estimated in a barn, because the gait of cows is dynamic and may change between 2 occasions. The objective of this study was to estimate the within-observer agreement according to the observers' educational background and experience with cattle, based on video recordings with very diverse types of gait. Groups of farmers, bovine veterinarians, first- and fourth-year veterinary students, researchers, and cattle-inexperienced sensory assessors evaluated mobility using a 5-point mobility score system developed specifically for walking cows (n=102 observers). The evaluation sessions were similar for all groups, lasted 75 min, and were organized as follows: introduction, test A, short training session, break, and test B. In total, video recordings of 22 cows were displayed twice in a random order (11 cows in each test \\xd7 2 replicates). Data were analyzed applying kappa coefficient, logistic regression, and testing for random effects of observers. The crude estimates of 95\\\\% confidence interval for weighted kappa in test A and B ranged, respectively, from 0.76 to 0.80 and 0.70 to 0.75. When adjusting for the fixed effects of video sample and gait scoring preferences, the probability of assigning the same mobility score twice to the same cow varied from 55\\\\% (sensory assessors) to 72\\\\% (fourth-year veterinary students). The random effect of the individual observers was negligible. That is, in general observers could categorize the mobility characteristics of cows quite well. Observers who preferred to assess the attributes back arch or the overall mobility score (based on uneven gait) had the highest agreement, respectively, 69 or 68\\\\%. The training session seemed insufficient to improve agreement. Nonetheless, even novice observers were able to achieve perfect agreement up to 60\\\\% of the 22 scorings with merely the experience obtained during the study (introduction and training session). The relatively small differences between groups, together with a high agreement, demonstrate that the new system is easy to follow compared with previously described scoring systems. The mobility score achieves sufficiently high within-observer repeatability to allow between-observer agreement estimates, which are reliable compared with other more-complex scoring systems. Consequently, the new scoring scale seems feasible for on-farm applications as a tool to monitor mobility within and between cows, for communication between farmers and veterinarians with diverse educational background, and for lamenessbenchmarking of herds.\", u'issn': u'1525-3198', u'number': u'7', u'month': u'jul', u'volume': u'98', u'pages': u'4560--4571', u'keyword': u'Humans, Animals, Female, Cattle, Male, Adult, Young Adult, Video Recording, Logistic Models, Observer Variation, Prevalence, Surveys and Questionnaires, animal welfare, Cattle Diseases, Gait, Lameness, Animal, mobility scoring, sensory assessor, within-observer agreement', u'year': u'2015', u'pmid': u'25935241', u'journal': u'Journal of Dairy Science', 'ID': 'garcia_experienced_2015'}\n",

More specifically, methods to determine tissue reference length and the transition from the strain-stiffening \"toe-region\" to the more linear region of the stress-strain curve of fibrous connective tissues are presented. According to a microstructural model for uniaxially loaded collagenous tissues, increasingly more fibers are recruited and bear load with increased tissue elongation. Fiber recruitment is represented statistically according to a Weibull probability density function (PDF). The Weibull PDF location parameter in this formulation corresponds to the stretch at which the first fibers begin to bear load and provides a convenient method of determining reference length. The toe-to-linear region transition is defined by utilizing the Weibull cumulative distribution function (CDF) which relates the fraction of loaded fibers to the tissue elongation. These techniques are illustrated using representative tendon and ligament data from the literature, and are shown to be applicable retrospectively to data from specimens that are not heavily preloaded.

However, the extension of this approach for high-throughput quantification of cellular morphological states has not been demonstrated. In this paper, we report the use of site-selective tissue image cytometry for the study of homologous recombination (HR) events during cell division in the pancreas of transgenic mice. Since HRs are rare events, recombinant cells distribute sparsely inside the organ. A detailed measurement throughout the whole tissue is thus not practical. Instead, the site selective two-photon tissue cytometer incorporates a low magnification, wide field, one-photon imaging subsystem that rapidly identifies regions of interest containing recombinant cell clusters. Subsequently, high-resolution three-dimensional assays based on two-photon microscopy can be performed only in these regions of interest. We further show that three-dimensional morphology extraction algorithms can be used to analyse the resultant high-resolution two-photon image stacks providing information not only on the frequency and the distribution of these recombinant cell clusters and their constituent cells, but also on their morphology.', u'issn': u'1742-5689', u'month': u'feb', u'volume': u'6 Suppl 1', u'pages': u'S45--57', u'keyword': u'Animals, Mice, Microscopy, Pancreas, Image Cytometry', 'ID': 'kwon_quantitative_2009', u'year': u'2009', u'pmid': u'19049958', u'journal': u'Journal of the Royal Society, Interface', u'pmcid': u'PMC2706467'}\n",

Use of arterial oxygen saturation levels (SaO2), especially as assayed by the Nellcor instrument, has spread almost everywhere in medicine despite the fact that hypoxia of internal organs, liver, kidney, brain, pancreas, etc. is not well indicated by peripheral digital oxygenation. Indeed, there is an implied liability in the failure to infer central oxygenation from peripheral values. Near infrared (NIR) sensing of deep tissue saturation of hemoglobin (StO2) requires multi-wavelength, multi-site measurement of both absorption and scattering properties by time or frequency domain NIR methods. Corrections for underlying water and lipid absorptions can be made so that the correct value for, and saturation oh hemoglobin are obtained. Nevertheless, the significance of blood oxygen saturation, even localized to particular organs, can be questioned from the standpoint of what is the critical value of the desaturation from which the tissue can recover; for example, in the case of cortical neurons where stroke, compression ischemia, etc. cause O2 lack, this value becomes of significant clinical importance in both the brain and the spinal chord. These approaches are actively pursued and the possibility of subsurface redox state measurement in human tissues may eventually emerge as the quantitative metric of tissue metabolic state and of hypoxic stress.

The OG488 dye is fixed at the 5(') end of one strand, and the TMR label position is allowed to vary along the complimentary strand. Since OG488 and TMR are FRET pairs, the FRET efficiency can be determined theoretically from the distance separating the two dyes of the double-stranded DNA molecules.

An evaluation of TACS-3 was performed in biopsied tissue sections from 196 patients by second harmonic generation imaging of the backscattered signal generated by collagen. Univariate analysis of a Cox proportional hazard model demonstrated that the presence of TACS-3 was associated with poor disease-specific and disease-free survival, resulting in hazard ratios between 3.0 and 3.9. Furthermore, TACS-3 was confirmed to be an independent prognostic indicator regardless of tumor grade and size, estrogen or progesterone receptor status, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 status, node status, and tumor subtype.

In the first set of experiments the transcriptional response of the two transcription factors ERF6 and ERF105 that had previously been shown to rapidly respond to light was shown to be deregulated in the pad2 mutant but not in the vtc1 background. The transcriptional response after combining the low-to-high light transfer with methylviologen pretreatment further demonstrated the significance of glutathione in strongly modulating the retrograde response. Transcripts encoding small heat shock proteins (HSP17.4, HSP176a, HSP20-like1 and HSP20-like2) and the lipid transfer protein LTP3 were taken as markers responding to the combinatorial treatment in wild type, and most strongly in pad2 in high light or upon methylviologen treatment.

However, the methods evolved have played an important role in several areas of biochemistry and biophysics including photosynthesis. Improvements of rapid reaction methods, based upon the pioneering studies of Hamilton Hartridge and F.J.W. Roughton, and Glenn Millikan, required a detailed study of the hydraulics of small-bore tubes and jet mixers, taking into account, that economy of reactants was demanded by the sparcity of enzyme preparations in the 1930s. This Personal perspective recites the steps taken to minimize the volumes expended in rapid flow studies, together with the improvements in electronic technology of rapid and sensitive spectrophotometry of labile intermediates in enzyme reactions. Of the methods studied, continuous, accelerated and stopped flow, the latter was designed for the highest fluid economy and subsequently proved to be of wide use for studying biochemical kinetics. Advances in fast spectrophotometry of dilute solutions led to great improvements in Millikan's dual-wavelength system, both in speed of recording and decreases of background noise level, largely due to electronic stabilization of light sources and sensitive amplifiers. The application of these technologies to studies of hemoglobin, myoglobin and heme enzymes was, more recently, followed by studies of suspensions of organelles, cells, and tissues not only in vivo but also at low temperatures with cryoprotectants, leading to the use of flash activation in carbon monoxide inhibited heme enzymes. Laser technology allowed photosynthetic systems to be studied at cryotemperatures, leading to the development of electron tunneling theories for biological reactions (not discussed in this paper).

Previous studies suggest that only some of the tissues encountered during these procedures can be identified by spectroscopic methods, and no previous study has investigated the use of Raman, diffuse reflectance, and fluorescence spectroscopies. The authors hypothesized that real-time needle-tip spectroscopy may aid epidural needle placement and tested the ability of spectroscopy to distinguish each of the tissues in the path of neuraxial needles.\\nMETHODS: For comparison of detection methods, the spectra of individual, dissected ex vivo paravertebral and neuraxial porcine tissues were collected using Raman spectroscopy (RS), diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, and fluorescence spectroscopy. Real-time spectral guidance was tested using a 2-mm inner-diameter fiber-optic probe-in-needle device. Raman spectra were collected during the needle's passage through intact paravertebral and neuraxial porcine tissue and analyzed afterward. The RS tissue signatures were verified as mapping to individual tissue layers using histochemical staining and widefield microscopy.\\nRESULTS: RS revealed a unique spectrum for all ex vivo paravertebral and neuraxial tissue layers; diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy were not distinct for all tissues. Moreover, when accounting for the expected order of tissues, real-time Raman spectra recorded during needle insertion also permitted identification of each paravertebral and neuraxial porcine tissue.\\nCONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that RS can distinguish the tissues encountered during epidural needle insertion.

This instrument was used in 6 pregnant women ({\\\\textgreater}36 weeks of gestation). First, a fetal heart rate was obtained with a fetal heart rate monitor. Then, the depth of fetal tissue (head) from the maternal abdomen was determined by ultrasound examination; the distance between the optodes (light source and the detector) was set to be approximately twice the depth of the fetus (7-11 cm). The data analysis was based on the modified Beer-Lambert law and the use of optical densities at 735 and 850 nm to obtain the concentration changes of the oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin. The saturation was expressed as the percent of oxygen saturation equal to 100 x oxyhemoglobin/(oxyhemoglobin + deoxyhemoglobin). We recorded the spectroscopy data and the fetal heart rate for approximately 3 to 10 minutes in each patient.\\nRESULTS: The mean oxygen saturation values of each of the 6 individual fetuses ranged from 50\\\\% to 74\\\\% (overall mean saturation, 61\\\\% +/- 14.8\\\\% [SD]).\\nCONCLUSION: This preliminary data indicate that transabdominal fetal pulse oximetry is feasible for human patient application.

Any measures used to stabilize or normalize coagulation are therefore of great interest. Administration of packed red cells, fresh frozen plasma, and platelet concentrates is associated with volume loading, which is suspected to multiply the secondary brain damage, for example, by the development of an edema. In this respect, the administration of rFVIIa may develop into a new option associated with low-volume administration.\\nCASE DESCRIPTIONS: We report on 5 neurosurgical patients to whom rFVIIa was given at doses of 51 to 202 microg/kg of body weight for the treatment of severe intraoperative bleeding (n = 3) or as prophylaxis of bleeding (n = 2). The operation was completed successfully in all patients after administration of rFVIIa, with stabilization of the coagulation status.\\nCONCLUSION: Therefore, reported cases constitute an approach in treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding complications in neurosurgery. There are reports of thromboembolic events in use of rFVIIa, particularly in unlabeled use. But according to our findings and current literature, there is no evidence of higher risk of thromboembolic adverse events in treatment with rFVIIa. However, the number of patients presented does not allow any final assessment to be made as to whether the properties of rFVIIa are of particular benefit for neurosurgical patients.

Recent progress has been made in defining some of the molecular mechanisms by which adhesion disassembly is regulated, including the contributions of adhesion adaptor proteins and tyrosine kinases. However, little is known about the potential contribution of proteolytic mechanisms to the regulation of adhesion complex dynamics. Here, we show that proteolysis of talin by the intracellular calcium-dependent protease calpain is critical for focal adhesion disassembly. We have generated a single point mutation in talin that renders it resistant to proteolysis by calpain. Quantification of adhesion assembly and disassembly rates demonstrates that calpain-mediated talin proteolysis is a rate-limiting step during adhesion turnover. Furthermore, we demonstrate that disassembly of other adhesion components, including paxillin, vinculin and zyxin, is also dependent on the ability of calpain to cleave talin, suggesting a general role for talin proteolysis in regulating adhesion turnover. Together, these findings identify calpain-mediated proteolysis of talin as a mechanism by which adhesion dynamics are regulated.', u'issn': u'1465-7392', u'number': u'10', u'month': u'oct', u'volume': u'6', u'pages': u'977--983', u'keyword': u'Humans, Animals, Mice, NIH 3T3 Cells, Focal Adhesions, Microscopy, Fluorescence, Immunohistochemistry, Cell Line, Fibronectins, Cell Adhesion, Phosphoproteins, RNA, Small Interfering, Blotting, Western, Precipitin Tests, Cytoskeletal Proteins, Paxillin, Kinetics, Talin, Vinculin, Calpain, Glycoproteins, Zyxin, Point Mutation, Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', u'year': u'2004', u'pmid': u'15448700', u'journal': u'Nature Cell Biology', 'ID': 'franco_calpain-mediated_2004'}\n",

Yet, effective enforcement is often a precondition for alternative conservation measures, such as payments for environmental services, to achieve desired outcomes. Fair and efficient policies to reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD) will thus crucially depend on understanding the determinants and requirements of enforcement effectiveness. Among potential REDD candidate countries, Brazil is considered to possess the most advanced deforestation monitoring and enforcement infrastructure. This study explores a unique dataset of over 15 thousand point coordinates of enforcement missions in the Brazilian Amazon during 2009 and 2010, after major reductions of deforestation in the region. We study whether local deforestation patterns have been affected by field-based enforcement and to what extent these effects vary across administrative boundaries. Spatial matching and regression techniques are applied at different spatial resolutions. We find that field-based enforcement operations have not been universally effective in deterring deforestation during our observation period. Inspections have been most effective in reducing large-scale deforestation in the states of Mato Grosso and Par\\xe1, where average conservation effects were 4.0 and 9.9 hectares per inspection, respectively.

Here, we demonstrate inhibitory effects of PF-562,271 on the activation of primary human and mouse T cells. PF-562,271 inhibits T cell receptor signaling-induced T cell adhesion to intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and T cell interactions with antigen-presenting cells. An additional focal adhesion kinase inhibitor, PF-573,228, and genetic depletion of focal adhesion kinase also impair T cell conjugation with antigen-presenting cells. PF-562,271 blocks phosphorylation of the signaling molecules zeta chain associate protein of 70 kDa, linker of activated T cells, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and impairs T cell proliferation. The effects observed on T cell proliferation cannot solely be attributed to focal adhesion kinase inhibition, as genetic depletion did not alter proliferation. The effect of PF-562,271 on T cell proliferation is not rescued when proximal T cell receptor signaling is bypassed by stimulation with phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate and ionomycin.

To probe the role of filamin binding, we mapped the filamin-binding site of integrin tails and identified amino acid substitutions that led to selective loss of filamin binding to the beta7 tail and gain of filamin binding to the beta1A tail.

Using different fluorescence fluctuation approaches, we established that paxillin-EGFP is dynamic on many timescales within the cell, ranging from milliseconds to seconds. In the cytoplasmic regions, far from adhesions, paxillin is uniformly distributed and freely diffusing as a monomer, as determined by single-point fluctuation correlation spectroscopy and photon-counting histogram analysis. Near adhesions, paxillin dynamics are reduced drastically, presumably due to binding to protein partners within the adhesions. The photon-counting histogram analysis of the fluctuation amplitudes reveals that this binding equilibrium in new or assembling adhesions is due to paxillin monomers binding to quasi-immobile structures, whereas in disassembling adhesions or regions of adhesions, the equilibrium is due to exchange of large aggregates. Scanning fluctuation correlation spectroscopy and raster-scan image correlation spectroscopy analysis of laser confocal images show that the environments within adhesions are heterogeneous. Relatively large adhesions appear to slide transversally due to a treadmilling mechanism through the addition of monomeric paxillin at one side and removal of relatively large aggregates of proteins from the retracting edge.

PCH has been characterized and applied in vitro, but its potential for in vivo studies needs to be explored. Thus, this study mainly focuses on the characterization of PCH analysis in vivo. The strength of PCH lies in its ability to distinguish biomolecules by their molecular brightness value. Because the concept of molecular brightness is crucial for PCH analysis, we study the molecular brightness of EGFP and determine the statistical accuracy of its measurement under in vivo conditions. We started by characterizing the influence of autofluorescence on EGFP measurements. We found a molecular brightness of EGFP that is a factor of 10 higher than the brightness of the autofluorescence. Moment analysis demonstrates that the contribution of autofluorescence to fluorescence fluctuation experiments is negligible at EGFP concentrations of one protein per excitation volume. The molecular brightness of EGFP measured in the nucleus, the cytoplasm, and in vitro are identical and our study demonstrates that molecular brightness is a very stable and predictable quantity for cellular measurements. In addition to PCH, we also analyzed the autocorrelation function of EGFP. The diffusion coefficient of EGFP is a factor of 3 lower in vivo than compared to in vitro, and a simple diffusion process describes the autocorrelation function. We found that in the nucleus the fluorescence intensity is stable as a function of time, while measurements in the cytoplasm display fluorescence intensity drifts that complicate the data analysis. We introduce and discuss an analysis method that minimizes the influence of the intensity drifts on PCH analysis. This method allows us to recover the correct molecular brightness of EGFP even in the presence of drifts of the fluorescence intensity signal. We found the molecular brightness of EGFP to be a very robust parameter, and anticipate the use of PCH analysis for the study of oligomerization processes in vivo.', u'issn': u'0006-3495', u'number': u'1 Pt 1', u'month': u'jan', u'volume': u'82', u'link': u'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1302455/', u'pages': u'133--144', u'file': u'PubMed Central Full Text PDF:C\\\\:\\\\\\\\Users\\\\\\\\lociuser\\\\\\\\Zotero\\\\\\\\storage\\\\\\\\8UYTHEBV\\\\\\\\Chen et al. - 2002 - Molecular brightness characterization of EGFP in v.pdf:application/pdf', u'year': u'2002', u'urldate': u'2017-11-23', u'pmid': u'11751302', 'ID': 'chen_molecular_2002', u'journal': u'Biophysical Journal', u'pmcid': u'PMC1302455'}\n",

Mechanically loading bone generates fluid shear stress (FSS) across the surface of bone cells resulting in the induction of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and release of prostaglandins, both of which are necessary for mechanically induced bone formation. However, the mechanisms by which cells transduce FSS-induced signals across the membrane and into the cell remain poorly understood. Focal adhesions, which are specialized sites of attachment between cells and the extracellular matrix, play a role in signal transduction and have been proposed to function as mechanosensors. To directly test whether focal adhesions mediate mechanotransduction in bone cells, we inhibited the formation of focal adhesions by 1). culturing MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts on bovine serum albumin (BSA), which does not contain integrin binding sites or by 2). treating cells cultured on fibronectin with soluble Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (RGDS) peptide to specifically block integrin-fibronectin interactions. We then subjected the cells to FSS and measured COX-2 induction and PGE(2) release. Both COX-2 induction and PGE(2) release in response to FSS were significantly decreased when osteoblasts were treated with soluble RGDS peptide compared with controls. However, RGDS peptide treatment did not affect FSS-induced ERK phosphorylation. Interestingly, osteoblasts cultured on BSA to suppress focal adhesion formation secreted fibronectin and increased focal adhesion formation over time, which correlated with the induction of COX-2 in response to FSS. Together, these results suggest that fibronectin-induced formation of focal adhesions promotes FSS-induced PGE(2) release and upregulation of COX-2 protein.', u'issn': u'8750-7587', u'number': u'1', u'month': u'jul', u'volume': u'97', u'pages': u'135--142', u'keyword': u'Animals, Mice, Focal Adhesions, Microscopy, Fluorescence, Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases, Phosphorylation, Isoenzymes, Non-NASA Center, Cell Line, Culture Media, Fibronectins, 3T3 Cells, Cyclooxygenase 2, Enzyme Induction, Osteoblasts, Dinoprostone, Immunoblotting, NASA Discipline Cell Biology, Oligopeptides, Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases, Serum Albumin, Bovine, Shear Strength, Up-Regulation', u'year': u'2004', u'pmid': u'15004000', u'journal': u'Journal of Applied Physiology (Bethesda, Md.: 1985)', 'ID': 'ponik_formation_2004'}\n",

The growth and physiology of bacterial cells in these colonies may be influenced by the microenvironment around the colony, or alternatively the cells within the colony may modify the microenvironment (e.g., pH, redox potential) due to their metabolic activity. While cheese pH may be measured at macro level there remains a significant knowledge gap relating to the degree of micro-heterogeneity of pH within the cheese matrix and its relationship with microbial, enzymatic and physiochemical parameters and ultimately with cheese quality, consistency and ripening patterns. The pH of cheese samples was monitored both at macroscopic scale and at microscopic scale, using a non-destructive microscopic technique employing C-SNARF-4 and Oregon Green 488 fluorescent probes. The objectives of this work were to evaluate the suitability of these dyes for microscale pH measurements in natural cheese matrices and to enhance the sensitivity and extend the useful pH range of these probes using fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM).

The aim of this study was to determine whether activation of AMPK by acute renal ischemia influences the severity of renal IRI.\\n\\nMethods\\nAMPK expression and activation and the severity of renal IRI was studied in mice lacking the AMPK \\u03b21 subunit and compared to wild type (WT) mice.\\n\\nResults\\nBasal expression of activated AMPK, phosphorylayed at \\u03b1Thr172, was markedly reduced by 96\\\\% in AMPK-\\u03b21\\u2212/\\u2212 mice. Acute renal ischaemia caused a 3.2-fold increase in \\u03b11-AMPK activity and a 2.5-fold increase in \\u03b12-AMPK activity (P{\\\\textless}0.001) that was associated with an increase in AMPK phosphorylation of the AMPK-\\u03b1 subunit at Thr172 and Ser485, and increased inhibitory phosphorylation of the AMPK substrate acetyl-CoA carboxylase. After acute renal ischemia AMPK activity was reduced by 66\\\\% in AMPK-\\u03b21\\u2212/\\u2212 mice compared with WT. There was no difference, however, in the severity of renal IRI at 24-hours between AMPK-\\u03b21\\u2212/\\u2212 and WT mice, as measured by serum urea and creatinine and histological injury score.

Alternatively, ECM stiffness can be modulated independently from protein concentration by mechanically loading the ECM. We have developed a novel device for generating stiffness gradients in naturally derived ECMs, where stiffness is tuned by inducing strain, while local mechanical properties are directly determined by laser tweezers based active microrheology (AMR). Hydrogel substrates polymerized within 35 mm diameter Petri dishes are strained non-uniformly by the precise rotation of an embedded cylindrical post, and exhibit a position-dependent stiffness with little to no modulation of local mesh geometry. Here we present the device in the context of fibrin hydrogels. First AMR is used to directly measure local micromechanics in unstrained hydrogels of increasing fibrin concentration. Changes in stiffness are then mapped within our device, where fibrin concentration is held constant. Fluorescence confocal imaging and orbital particle tracking are used to quantify structural changes in fibrin on the micro and nano levels respectively. The micromechanical strain stiffening measured by microrheology is not accompanied by ECM microstructural changes under our applied loads, as measured by confocal microscopy. However, super-resolution orbital tracking reveals nanostructural straightening, lengthening, and reduced movement of fibrin fibers. Furthermore, we show that aortic smooth muscle cells cultured within our device are morphologically sensitive to the induced mechanical gradient.

These olfactory subsystems use different neuronal signal transduction pathways, receptor expression repertoires, and axonal projection targets. The Grueneberg Ganglion (GG) is a newly-appreciated olfactory subsystem with receptor neurons located just inside of the nostrils that project axons to a unique domain of interconnected glomeruli in the caudal olfactory bulb. It is not well-understood how the GG relates to other olfactory subsystems in contributing to the olfactory sense. Furthermore, the range of chemoreceptors and the signal transduction cascade utilized by the GG have remained mysterious. To resolve these unknowns, we explored the molecular relationship between the GG and the GC-D neurons, another olfactory subsystem that innervates similarly-interconnected glomeruli in the same bulbar region. We found that mouse GG neurons express the cGMP-associated signaling proteins phosphodiesterase 2a, cGMP-dependent kinase II, and cyclic nucleotide gated channel subunit A3 coupled to a chemoreceptor repertoire of cilia-localized particulate guanylyl cyclases (pGC-G and pGC-A). The primary cGMP signaling pathway of the GG is shared with the GC-D neurons, unifying their target glomeruli as a unique center of olfactory cGMP signal transduction. However, the distinct chemoreceptor repertoire in the GG suggests that the GG is an independent olfactory subsystem. This subsystem is well-suited to detect a unique set of odors and to mediate behaviors that remained intact in previous olfactory perturbations.', u'issn': u'0021-9967', u'number': u'1', u'month': u'sep', u'volume': u'516', u'link': u'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4314211/', u'pages': u'36--48', u'file': u'PubMed Central Full Text PDF:C\\\\:\\\\\\\\Users\\\\\\\\lociuser\\\\\\\\Zotero\\\\\\\\storage\\\\\\\\8ZZHJMVU\\\\\\\\Liu et al. - 2009 - The Grueneberg Ganglion olfactory subsystem employ.pdf:application/pdf', u'year': u'2009', u'urldate': u'2017-11-23', u'pmid': u'19565523', 'ID': 'liu_grueneberg_2009', u'journal': u'The Journal of comparative neurology', u'pmcid': u'PMC4314211'}\n",

To visualize biological fluid flow, devising the proper labeling method compatible with both normal biology and in vivo imaging remains a major experimental challenge.

An all-optical procedure combining femtosecond laser ablation, fast confocal microscopy and 3D-particle tracking was devised to label, image and quantify the flow. This approach is illustrated by studying the flow generated within a micrometer scale ciliated vesicle located deep inside the zebrafish embryo and involved in breaking left-right embryonic symmetry.

It is well established that VP40 assembles on the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane of human cells to regulate viral budding where VP40 can produce virus like particles (VLPs) without other Ebola virus proteins present. The mechanistic details, however, of VP40 lipid-interactions and protein-protein interactions that are important for viral release remain to be elucidated. Here, we mutated a loop region in the N-terminal domain of VP40 (Lys127, Thr129, and Asn130) and find that mutations (K127A, T129A, and N130A) in this loop region reduce plasma membrane localization of VP40. Additionally, using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy and number and brightness analysis we demonstrate these mutations greatly reduce VP40 oligomerization.

Here we provide evidence that IFITM proteins restrict membrane fusion induced by representatives of all three classes of viral membrane fusion proteins. IFITM1 profoundly suppressed syncytia formation and cell-cell fusion induced by almost all viral fusion proteins examined; IFITM2 and IFITM3 also strongly inhibited their fusion, with efficiency somewhat dependent on cell types. Furthermore, treatment of cells with IFN also markedly inhibited viral membrane fusion and entry. By using the Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus envelope and influenza A virus hemagglutinin as models for study, we showed that IFITM-mediated restriction on membrane fusion is not at the steps of receptor- and/or low pH-mediated triggering; instead, the creation of hemifusion was essentially blocked by IFITMs. Chlorpromazine (CPZ), a chemical known to promote the transition from hemifusion to full fusion, was unable to rescue the IFITM-mediated restriction on fusion. In contrast, oleic acid (OA), a lipid analog that generates negative spontaneous curvature and thereby promotes hemifusion, virtually overcame the restriction. To explore the possible effect of IFITM proteins on membrane molecular order and fluidity, we performed fluorescence labeling with Laurdan, in conjunction with two-photon laser scanning and fluorescence-lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). We observed that the generalized polarizations (GPs) and fluorescence lifetimes of cell membranes expressing IFITM proteins were greatly enhanced, indicating higher molecularly ordered and less fluidized membranes. Collectively, our data demonstrated that IFITM proteins suppress viral membrane fusion before the creation of hemifusion, and suggested that they may do so by reducing membrane fluidity and conferring a positive spontaneous curvature in the outer leaflets of cell membranes. Our study provides novel insight into the understanding of how IFITM protein family restricts viral membrane fusion and infection., Many pathogenic viruses contain an envelope that must fuse with the cell membrane in order to gain entry and initiate infection. This process is mediated by one or more glycoproteins present on the surface of the virions, known as viral fusion proteins. Recently, a family of interferon-inducible transmembrane (IFITM) protein has been shown to block viral infection, including those of highly pathogenic viruses. Here we provide evidence that these IFITM proteins potently suppress membrane fusion induced by representatives of all three classes of viral fusion proteins. Interestingly, we found that the block is not at the steps of receptor binding or low pH that triggers conformational changes of viral fusion proteins required for membrane fusion. Rather, we discovered that the creation of hemifusion, an intermediate in which the outer membranes of the two lipid bilayers have merged but the inner membranes still remain intact is blocked by IFITM proteins. We further demonstrated that overexpression of IFITM proteins rigidify the cell membrane, thereby reducing membrane fluidity and fusion potential.

To assess the role of calpain in migration, we used fibroblasts obtained from Capn4(-/-) mouse embryos.

However, proteolysis of the focal complex component, talin, was detected in the wild-type cells but not in the Capn4(-/-) cells, suggesting that calpain cleavage of talin is important during cell migration. Moreover, talin cleavage was again observed when calpain activity was partially restored in Capn4(-/-) embryonic fibroblasts by stable transfection with a vector expressing the rat 28-kDa calpain small subunit.

We investigated which early platelet signaling events, if any, could be attributed specifically to the binding of collagen to one of its receptors, the alpha2beta1 integrin. Treatment of platelets with collagen induced a rapid activation of the non-receptor tyrosine kinase, Syk, as measured by an increase in phosphorylation and kinase activity. Collagen also induced the rapid phosphorylation of phospholipase Cgamma2 (PLCgamma2). The phosphorylation of both Syk and PLCgamma2, as well as platelet aggregation, was blocked by an anti-alpha2beta1 integrin monoclonal antibody (P1E6), demonstrating that collagen binding to alpha2beta1 is necessary for signaling. Cross-linking of the alpha2beta1 integrin with stimulatory monoclonal antibody against either the beta1 or alpha2 subunit stimulated the phosphorylation of both Syk and PLCgamma2. However, antibody stimulation was dependent on co-stimulation of the FcgammaII receptor (CD32) since specific F(ab')2 fragments did not induce Syk and PLCgamma2 phosphorylation. Thus, these results suggest that occupancy of alpha2beta1 by collagen is necessary, but that a co-receptor, in addition to alpha2beta1, is required for these collagen-induced signaling events. Moreover, the P1E6 antibody did not inhibit all collagen-induced tyrosine phosphorylation events, demonstrating that collagen also induces phosphorylation events that are independent of the alpha2beta1 integrin. In addition to Syk and PLCgamma2, we identified the FcgammaII receptor (FcgammaRII) as being rapidly phosphorylated in response to collagen stimulation, even in the absence of antibodies. Finally, to determine if Syk activation precedes and directly contributes to the phosphorylation of PLCgamma2, platelets were preincubated with the Syk-selective kinase inhibitor, piceatannol. A concentration of piceatannol that inhibited the phosphorylation and kinase activity of Syk, but had no effect on Src kinase activity, blocked the collagen-induced phosphorylation of PLCgamma2 and also inhibited collagen-induced platelet aggregation. Our results begin to delineate a signaling pathway whereby occupancy of the alpha2beta1 integrin is required, but not sufficient, for collagen-induced activation of Syk and the subsequent phosphorylation of PLCgamma2. These events are necessary for platelet activation and aggregation in response to collagen.\", u'issn': u'0021-9258', u'number': u'43', u'month': u'oct', u'volume': u'271', u'pages': u'26668--26676', u'keyword': u'Collagen, Humans, Phosphorylation, Integrins, Isoenzymes, Receptors, Collagen, Protein-Tyrosine Kinases, Type C Phospholipases, Carrier Proteins, Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins, Tyrosine, Antibodies, Blood Platelets, Enzyme Precursors, Kinetics, Phospholipase C gamma, Receptors, Fc, Syk Kinase', u'year': u'1996', u'pmid': u'8900143', u'journal': u'The Journal of Biological Chemistry', 'ID': 'keely_alpha2beta1_1996'}\n",

A phase cancellation (in- and antiphase) device is used to increase the sensitivity in detecting fluorescent photons and the accuracy of tumor localization. The optoelectronic system consists of the laser diode sources, fiber optics, interference filter (to select the fluorescent photons), and the high-sensitivity photon detector (photomultiplier tube). The source-detector pair scans the tissue surface in multiple directions, and the localization image can be obtained by angular back-projection reconstruction. Simulations and experimental data demonstrated the feasibility of detection and localization offluorescent object embedded inside the highly scattering media. Tumor-bearing mouse model with injection of fluorescent contrast agents is used to simulate the human breast tumor labeled with molecular beacons. The system can detect fluorescent contrast agents as small as one nanomole at the depth of three centimeters, with a three-millimeter localization error.

To define the basic principles governing microtubule/F-actin interactions, we used dual-wavelength digital fluorescence and fluorescent speckle microscopy to analyze microtubules and F-actin labeled with spectrally distinct fluorophores in interphase Xenopus egg extracts. In the absence of microtubules, networks of F-actin bundles zippered together or exhibited serpentine gliding along the coverslip. When microtubules were nucleated from Xenopus sperm centrosomes, they were released and translocated away from the aster center. In the presence of microtubules, F-actin exhibited two distinct, microtubule-dependent motilities: rapid (\\u223c250\\u2013300 nm/s) jerking and slow (\\u223c50 nm/s), straight gliding. Microtubules remodeled the F-actin network, as F-actin jerking caused centrifugal clearing of F-actin from around aster centers. F-actin jerking occurred when F-actin bound to motile microtubules powered by cytoplasmic dynein. F-actin straight gliding occurred when F-actin bundles translocated along the microtubule lattice. These interactions required Xenopus cytosolic factors. Localization of myosin-II to F-actin suggested it may power F-actin zippering, while localization of myosin-V on microtubules suggested it could mediate interactions between microtubules and F-actin.

Transport through the pore is restricted by a hydrophobic selectivity filter comprising disordered phenylalanine-glycine-rich repeats of nuclear pore proteins. Exchange through the pore requires specialized transport receptors, called exportins and importins, that interact with cargo proteins in a RanGTP-dependent manner. These receptors are highly flexible superhelical structures composed of HEAT-repeat motifs that adopt various degrees of extension in crystal structures. Here, we performed molecular-dynamics simulations using crystal structures of Importin-\\u03b2 in its free form or in complex with nuclear localization signal peptides as the starting conformation. Our simulations predicted that initially compact structures would adopt extended conformations in hydrophilic buffers, while contracted conformations would dominate in more hydrophobic solutions, mimicking the environment of the nuclear pore. We confirmed this experimentally by F\\xf6rster resonance energy transfer experiments using dual-fluorophore-labeled Importin-\\u03b2. These observations explain seemingly contradictory crystal structures and suggest a possible mechanism for cargo protection during passage of the nuclear pore. Such hydrophobic switching may be a general principle for environmental control of protein function.', u'issn': u'0006-3495', u'number': u'2', u'month': u'jul', u'volume': u'109', u'link': u'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4621615/', u'pages': u'277--286', u'file': u'PubMed Central Full Text PDF:C\\\\:\\\\\\\\Users\\\\\\\\lociuser\\\\\\\\Zotero\\\\\\\\storage\\\\\\\\3EDM5BY4\\\\\\\\Halder et al. - 2015 - MD Simulations and FRET Reveal an Environment-Sens.pdf:application/pdf', u'year': u'2015', u'urldate': u'2017-11-23', u'pmid': u'26200863', 'ID': 'halder_md_2015', u'journal': u'Biophysical Journal', u'pmcid': u'PMC4621615'}\n",

Following UE, a trial of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) may be considered if a neonate is showing adequate respiratory effort. This study investigated the success and failure rate of NIV management of neonates experiencing UE.\\nSTUDY DESIGN: Retrospective single-center study of neonates experiencing UE in the NICU over a 9-year period. Reintubation within 12 hours of a trial of NIV following UE was defined as treatment failure. Short-term respiratory outcomes were analyzed for all infants plus the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia for preterm infants born less than 32 weeks' gestation.\\nRESULTS: A total of 43 patients were included. Of those, 30 infants were trialed on NIV following UE. Baseline demographics were similar between both the groups except for the oxygen requirement before UE. The NIV was successful in 20 and failed in 10 infants. Infants who failed a trial of the NIV were reintubated between 0.45 and 5.25 hours following UE. Respiratory outcomes in very preterm infants did not differ between groups.\\nCONCLUSION: A trial of NIV may be considered as a treatment option in preterm and term newborns experiencing UE in the NICU.\", u'issn': u'1098-8785', u'number': u'11', u'month': u'sep', u'volume': u'32', u'pages': u'1059--1063', u'keyword': u'Humans, Female, Male, Oxygen, Infant, Newborn, Retrospective Studies, Gestational Age, Infant, Extremely Premature, Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia, Infant, Extremely Low Birth Weight, Intensive Care Units, Neonatal, Noninvasive Ventilation, Respiratory Insufficiency, Treatment Failure', u'year': u'2015', u'pmid': u'25915142', u'journal': u'American Journal of Perinatology', 'ID': 'nesbitt_unplanned_2015'}\n",

The operation of the KOALA platform is user-friendly and consists of bringing together a lid containing the microchannels, and a base containing the pre-packaged reagents, thereby causing fluidic exchange in all the channels simultaneously.
