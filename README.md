# mink
A version_control_on_ltc_analysis

## MINK handles *.r64 files and *.sdt/*.asc files for lifetime analysis
The code is compiled with multiple binary file dependencies in the pyc folder.
the versions are controlled by the folder dates and can be launched from python 2.7 by calling run_mink()

The win-build has mpl and qt dependencies.
